# Task 8: Fix Type System and Lint Compliance - Status Report

## Current Status
Task 8 shows all subtasks as completed (100%), but verification reveals the following issues:

### 1. MyPy Type Checking
- **Fixed**: Syntax errors in test files that were preventing mypy from running
  - `tests/performance/test_no_performance_theater.py` - Fixed invalid syntax in if statements and dictionaries
  - `tests/unit/test_performance_theater_removal.py` - Fixed incomplete assert statements
  - `tests/unit/test_task_9_1_mock_pattern_audit.py` - Fixed incomplete assert statements
- **Status**: MyPy now runs without syntax errors
- **Remaining**: Need to verify all type annotations are correct

### 2. Flake8 Linting
- **Total Violations**: 10,756 in main code directories
- **Top Issues**:
  - W293: blank line contains whitespace (6,387)
  - E501: line too long (2,609)
  - F401: imported but unused (674)
  - W291: trailing whitespace (377)
  - F841: local variable assigned but never used (202)
- **Status**: Significant linting issues remain

### 3. TypeScript Interfaces
- **Errors Found**: Multiple TypeScript compilation errors
  - Missing module declarations
  - Implicit 'any' types
  - Missing type definitions for Jest matchers
- **Status**: TypeScript compilation has errors

### 4. Pre-commit Hooks
- **Status**: Pre-commit is installed but configuration file appears to be missing
- **Action Taken**: Installed pre-commit hooks with `pre-commit install`

## Recommendations
1. The subtasks are marked as complete, but the actual implementation has gaps
2. Need to address the large number of flake8 violations
3. Fix TypeScript compilation errors
4. Restore or recreate pre-commit configuration file
5. Run comprehensive validation before marking Task 8 as done

## Files Fixed During This Session
1. `/home/green/FreeAgentics/tests/performance/test_no_performance_theater.py`
2. `/home/green/FreeAgentics/tests/unit/test_performance_theater_removal.py`
3. `/home/green/FreeAgentics/tests/unit/test_task_9_1_mock_pattern_audit.py`
