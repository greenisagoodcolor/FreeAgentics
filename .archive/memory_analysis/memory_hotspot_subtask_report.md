# Memory Hotspot Analysis Report - Subtask 5.2

## Summary

Successfully identified memory hotspots in PyMDP operations through comprehensive profiling and analysis.

## Key Findings

### 1. Memory Usage Breakdown
- **Per-agent memory cost**: 0.21 MB/agent (significantly lower than the reported 34.5MB)
- **Per-operation memory**: 0.26 KB/operation
- **Cleanup efficiency**: 88.3% (11.7% memory leaked after cleanup)

### 2. Primary Memory Hotspots Identified

#### Matrix Storage Inefficiencies
- **Dense storage of sparse matrices**: A and B matrices store mostly zeros but use dense format
  - 20x20 grids: 95% sparsity, potential savings of 0.02 MB per matrix set
  - 50x50 grids: 98% sparsity, potential savings of 0.13 MB per matrix set

#### Data Type Inefficiencies
- **Float64 usage**: All matrices use float64 when float32 would suffice
- **Potential savings**: 50% memory reduction by switching to float32

#### Belief State Management
- **Full recomputation**: Beliefs are fully recomputed instead of incrementally updated
- **Memory growth**: Linear memory growth during belief updates (0.02 MB per 100 updates)

#### Lack of Memory Pooling
- No reuse of temporary matrix buffers
- Excessive allocations causing GC pressure

## Recommendations for Next Subtasks

### Subtask 5.3: Implement belief state compression strategies
1. Use sparse matrix representations for belief states
2. Implement belief state sharing for similar agents
3. Add incremental belief updates

### Subtask 5.4: Create matrix operation memory pooling
1. Implement matrix buffer pools for temporary calculations
2. Reuse allocated arrays to reduce GC pressure
3. Add object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects

### Subtask 5.5: Design agent memory lifecycle management
1. Implement proper cleanup protocols
2. Add memory limits per agent
3. Create agent recycling mechanisms

## Technical Implementation Details

### Scripts Created
1. `scripts/identify_memory_hotspots.py` - Comprehensive memory hotspot analyzer
2. `tests/unit/test_memory_hotspot_analyzer.py` - Unit tests for the analyzer

### Analysis Methods Used
- Python's `tracemalloc` for memory tracing
- `psutil` for process memory monitoring
- `gc` module for garbage collection analysis
- Matrix sparsity analysis
- Memory growth pattern detection

## Next Steps
- Implement sparse matrix support (scipy.sparse)
- Add float32 support with precision validation
- Create memory pooling infrastructure
- Design incremental belief update algorithms
