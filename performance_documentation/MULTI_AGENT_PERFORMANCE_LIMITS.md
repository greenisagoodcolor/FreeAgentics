# Multi-Agent Coordination Performance Limits

*Generated: 2025-07-16 14:57:05*

## Executive Summary

The FreeAgentics multi-agent system exhibits significant performance limitations at scale:

- **Efficiency at 50 agents**: 28.4% (72% efficiency loss)
- **Memory per agent**: 34.5 MB (prohibitive for large deployments)
- **Threading advantage**: 3-49x better than multiprocessing
- **Real-time capability**: Limited to ~25 agents at 10ms target

These limitations stem from fundamental architectural constraints, primarily the Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and synchronous coordination patterns.
