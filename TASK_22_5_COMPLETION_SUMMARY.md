## Usage Examples

### Field-Level Encryption
```python
from security.encryption import create_field_encryptor

encryptor = create_field_encryptor(
    provider_type='aws_kms',
    key_id='alias/application-data'
)

encrypted = encryptor.encrypt_field('sensitive-data', 'ssn')
decrypted = encryptor.decrypt_field(encrypted, 'ssn')
```

### Quantum-Resistant Encryption
```python
from security.encryption import QuantumResistantCrypto

qrc = QuantumResistantCrypto()
keys = qrc.generate_hybrid_keypair()

encrypted = qrc.hybrid_encrypt(data, keys['kem'].public_key)
decrypted = qrc.hybrid_decrypt(encrypted, keys['kem'].private_key)
```

### SOAR Automation
```python
from security.soar import PlaybookEngine, IncidentManager

engine = PlaybookEngine(playbook_dir="./playbooks")
manager = IncidentManager(playbook_engine=engine)

case = manager.create_incident(
    title="Brute Force Attack",
    type=IncidentType.UNAUTHORIZED_ACCESS,
    severity=IncidentSeverity.HIGH
)
