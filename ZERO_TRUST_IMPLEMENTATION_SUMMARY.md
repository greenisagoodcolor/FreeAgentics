# Zero-Trust Network Architecture Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides a comprehensive Zero-Trust Network Architecture for the FreeAgentics system, ensuring that every request is authenticated, authorized, and continuously verified. The architecture follows the principle of "never trust, always verify" and implements defense in depth.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Mutual TLS (mTLS) Manager (`security/zero_trust/mtls_manager.py`)

The MTLSManager provides comprehensive certificate management with the following features:

#### Key Features:

### Network Security
- **Mutual TLS**: All service-to-service communication encrypted
- **Certificate Pinning**: Services validate expected certificate fingerprints
- **Network Segmentation**: Zone-based access controls
- **Traffic Encryption**: End-to-end encryption with configurable cipher suites

### Identity and Access Management
- **Service Identity**: Certificate-based service authentication
- **Fine-grained Authorization**: Operation-level permissions
- **Dynamic Policies**: Real-time policy evaluation
- **Risk-based Access**: Continuous risk assessment

## Performance Characteristics

### Latency Requirements
- **Certificate Generation**: <10ms average (with caching)
- **Request Validation**: <10ms overhead per request

## Usage Examples

### Basic mTLS Setup
```python
from security.zero_trust import MTLSManager

# Initialize mTLS manager
manager = MTLSManager(
    ca_cert_path="./certs/ca-cert.pem",
    ca_key_path="./certs/ca-key.pem",
    enable_key_cache=True,
)

# Generate service certificate
cert_info = manager.generate_service_certificate(
    service_name="my-service",
    dns_names=["my-service.local"],
    validity_days=30,
)
```

```python
from security.zero_trust import IdentityAwareProxy, ProxyConfig, ServicePolicy

# Configure proxy
config = ProxyConfig(
    enable_mtls=True,
    enable_risk_scoring=True,
    max_risk_score=0.7,
)
proxy = IdentityAwareProxy(config)

# Add service policy
proxy.add_service_policy(
    ServicePolicy(
        source_service="frontend",
        target_service="backend",
        allowed_operations=["read", "write"],
        mtls_required=True,
    )
)
```

### Service Mesh Configuration
```python
from security.zero_trust import ServiceMeshConfig, ServiceMeshType, generate_istio_config

# Create mesh configuration
config = ServiceMeshConfig(mesh_type=ServiceMeshType.ISTIO)

# Add services and policies
config.add_service("frontend", namespace="prod", port=80)
config.add_service("backend", namespace="prod", port=8080)

# Generate Istio configuration
istio_config = generate_istio_config(config)
```

## Security Considerations

### Certificate Security
