# Workflows to Delete - CI/CD Consolidation

## Committee Decision
After 50 years of engineering experience, we recommend deleting these workflows in favor of one simple, working pipeline.

## Files to Delete:

1. **ci-cd-pipeline.yml** - Redundant with main.yml
2. **ci.yml** - Replaced by main.yml
3. **coverage.yml** - Coverage integrated into main test job
4. **dependency-update.yml** - Use Dependabot config instead
5. **docker-multiarch.yml** - Add multi-arch when actually needed
6. **main-pipeline.yml** - Over-engineered (1328 lines!), replaced with simple main.yml
7. **performance-benchmarks.yml** - Add benchmarks when you have actual performance issues
8. **performance-monitoring.yml** - Premature optimization
9. **performance-regression-check.yml** - Add when you have a performance baseline
10. **performance.yml** - Consolidate performance testing when needed
11. **production-deployment.yml** - Integrated into main.yml deploy job
12. **production-release.yml** - Keep releases simple
13. **release.yml** - Use GitHub releases when needed
14. **security-ci.yml** - Integrated essential security into main.yml
15. **security-scan.yml** - Redundant security scanning
16. **security-scanning.yml** - More redundant security
17. **security-tests.yml** - Essential security in main.yml
18. **tdd-validation.yml** - Tests are in main.yml
19. **test-coverage.yml** - Coverage in main test job
20. **unified-pipeline.yml** - Another attempt at unification

## Keep These Files:
- **main.yml** - The ONE workflow
- **validate-pipeline.py** - Might be useful for validation
- **MIGRATION-GUIDE.md** - Documentation
- **PIPELINE-ARCHITECTURE.md** - Documentation
- **PIPELINE-DASHBOARD.md** - Documentation

## Migration Steps:

1. Review the new `main.yml` workflow
2. Update any deployment secrets/configurations
3. Delete all workflows listed above
4. Commit with message: "Simplify CI/CD: One workflow to rule them all"
5. Monitor the first few runs
6. Add complexity only when proven necessary

## Philosophy Reminder:

> "In my 50 years, I've seen every CI/CD trend come and go. The systems that survive are the simple ones that developers can understand and fix at 3 AM. Complex pipelines are resume-driven development. Simple pipelines ship software."

## Expected Benefits:

- **Faster feedback**: 5-minute quick checks vs 30+ minute complex pipelines
- **Easier debugging**: One file to check when things break
- **Lower maintenance**: 400 lines vs 5000+ lines of YAML
- **Higher velocity**: Developers aren't afraid to push code
- **Cost savings**: Fewer parallel jobs, less compute time

Remember: You can always add complexity later. You can rarely remove it.
