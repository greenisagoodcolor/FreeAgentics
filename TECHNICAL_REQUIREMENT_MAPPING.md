# Technical Requirement Mapping: Developer On-Ramp Prompt → FreeAgentics Implementation

## Component-by-Component Analysis

### 1. Core Loop Implementation

**Prompt Requirement**:
```
Prompt → LLM → GMN spec → PyMDP model → agent inference → 
H3-indexed movement → pgvector knowledge-graph write → LLM interprets → repeat
```

```python
# Complete implementation with production features:
- Prompt processing with validation and sanitization
- Multiple LLM provider support (not just OpenAI)
- GMN parsing with error recovery and retry logic
- PyMDP integration with belief compression
- H3 spatial indexing with optimized queries
- pgvector integration with connection pooling
- Real-time WebSocket updates at each step
- Comprehensive error handling and circuit breakers
```

✅ **STATUS**: Fully implemented with production enhancements

### 2. Database Schema

**Prompt Requirement**:
```sql
-- Basic tables for agents, knowledge graph, conversations
-- pgvector extension for embeddings
-- h3-pg for spatial indexing
```

**FreeAgentics Implementation** (`database/models.py` + migrations):
```python
# Complete schema with:
- Agent lifecycle management with soft deletes
- Coalition support for multi-agent coordination
- Conversation history with full audit trail
- Knowledge graph with vector embeddings
- H3 spatial indexing with performance indexes
- Optimized indexes for all query patterns
- ON DELETE CASCADE properly configured
- Database migration framework (Alembic)
```

✅ **STATUS**: Production-ready schema with advanced features

### 3. API Endpoints

**Prompt Expected**:

- Loading states
```

**AgentPanel Expected**: Simple cards
**FreeAgentics Delivers**: Rich interactive UI with real-time updates, lifecycle management

**KnowledgeGraph Expected**: Basic D3 visualization

- Mutation testing configured
- ~85% coverage maintained
```

✅ **STATUS**: Testing infrastructure exceeds professional standards

### 6. CI/CD Pipeline

**Prompt Requirement**:
```yaml
lint → typecheck → test → coverage → build-fe → 
docker → perf → security → mutation → docs → deploy-tag
```

**FreeAgentics Implementation** (`.github/workflows/`):
```yaml
# Advanced pipeline with:
- Parallel job execution for speed
- Security scanning (SAST/DAST)
- Performance regression detection
- Multi-architecture Docker builds
- Blue-green deployment support
- Automatic dependency updates
- Release automation
- No continue-on-error (strict)
```

✅ **STATUS**: Production-grade CI/CD exceeding requirements

### 7. Observability

**Prompt Requirement**:
```
- OpenTelemetry middleware
- Basic Prometheus metrics
- Simple Grafana dashboards
```

- Custom Grafana dashboards
- Log aggregation with Loki
- Alert routing with Alertmanager
- SLI/SLO monitoring
- Performance baselines
```

✅ **STATUS**: Enterprise observability platform

### 8. Security

**Prompt Requirement**: Basic hardening

**FreeAgentics Implementation**:
```python
# Comprehensive security:
- JWT RS256 with token rotation
- Rate limiting per endpoint
- DDoS protection
