## Initial Response

### Step 1: Immediate Actions (0-5 minutes)

1. **Confirm the Incident**
   ```bash
   # Check system status
   systemctl status freeagentics
   docker ps
   pg_isready -h postgres -p 5432
   ```

2. **Assess Impact**
   - [ ] Database accessible?
   - [ ] Application responding?
   - [ ] Redis cache available?
   - [ ] External services reachable?

3. **Emergency Notification**
   ```bash
   # Send immediate alert
   curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
     --data '{"text":"üö® EMERGENCY: FreeAgentics system experiencing issues - investigating"}' \
     $SLACK_WEBHOOK
   ```

### Step 2: Incident Command Setup (5-10 minutes)

1. **Establish Command Center**
