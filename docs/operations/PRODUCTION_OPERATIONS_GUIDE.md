- [ ] **Monitoring**: Health checks ready

### Deployment Process

#### 1. Prepare Deployment

```bash
# Set deployment variables
export RELEASE_VERSION=$(git describe --tags --always)
export DEPLOY_ENV=production
export ROLLBACK_VERSION=$(curl -s https://api.freeagentics.io/health | jq -r '.version')

# Pre-deployment checks
./scripts/deployment/pre-deployment-checks.sh

# Create deployment branch
git checkout -b deploy/${RELEASE_VERSION}
```

#### 2. Database Migrations

```bash
# Check for pending migrations
./scripts/deployment/check-migrations.sh

# Run migrations in staging first
./scripts/deployment/migrate-database.sh --env staging --dry-run

# Apply migrations to production
./scripts/deployment/migrate-database.sh --env production
```

#### 3. Deploy Application

```bash
# Deploy API service
./scripts/deployment/deploy-api.sh --version ${RELEASE_VERSION}

# Deploy frontend
./scripts/deployment/deploy-frontend.sh --version ${RELEASE_VERSION}

# Verify deployment
./scripts/deployment/verify-deployment.sh
```

#### 4. Post-Deployment Verification

```bash
# Health check
curl -f https://api.freeagentics.io/health

# Smoke tests
./scripts/deployment/smoke-tests.sh

# Monitor for 15 minutes
./scripts/deployment/post-deployment-monitor.sh --duration 15m
```

### Blue-Green Deployment

For zero-downtime deployments:

```bash
# 1. Deploy to green environment
./scripts/deployment/deploy-blue-green.sh --target green --version ${RELEASE_VERSION}

# 2. Verify green environment
./scripts/deployment/verify-environment.sh --env green

# 3. Switch traffic
./scripts/deployment/switch-traffic.sh --from blue --to green

# 4. Monitor and rollback if needed
./scripts/deployment/monitor-traffic-switch.sh
```

### Rollback Procedures

#### Immediate Rollback

```bash
# Quick rollback to previous version
./scripts/deployment/rollback.sh --to ${ROLLBACK_VERSION}

# Verify rollback
./scripts/deployment/verify-rollback.sh
```

#### Database Rollback

```bash
# Rollback database migrations (if needed)
./scripts/deployment/rollback-migrations.sh --to-version ${ROLLBACK_VERSION}

# Verify data integrity
./scripts/deployment/verify-data-integrity.sh
```
