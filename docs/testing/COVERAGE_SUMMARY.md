## 📊 Detailed Analysis

### Backend Coverage (Definitive)
- **Total Statements:** 27,340
- **Covered Statements:** 6,177
- **Coverage Percentage:** 18.65%
- **Total Branches:** 9,989
- **Measurement Method:** pytest-cov (comprehensive)
- **Confidence Level:** High (directly measured)

### Frontend Coverage (Estimated)
- **Test Files Found:** 83
- **Working Test Suites:** 1-5
- **Failed/Skipped Suites:** 78+
- **Coverage Percentage:** ~2-5% (extrapolated from working tests)
- **Measurement Method:** Jest sampling + analysis
- **Confidence Level:** Medium (estimated from samples)

### Combined Calculation
```
Backend Weight: ~70% (27,340 lines)
Frontend Weight: ~30% (12,000-15,000 lines estimated)

Combined Coverage = (18.65% × 0.70) + (3.5% × 0.30) = 13.05% + 1.05% = ~14.1%

## 🔍 Key Findings

### ✅ **What's Working**
1. **Backend Infrastructure:** Coverage measurement is comprehensive and reliable
2. **API Module:** Already at 84% coverage (excellent)
3. **Simple Frontend Tests:** Hook tests work perfectly
4. **Test Configuration:** Both pytest and Jest are properly configured

### ⚠️ **What Needs Attention**
1. **Frontend Test Quality:** 78+ test suites failing due to code issues
2. **Backend Core Modules:** Most modules below 25% coverage
3. **Integration Testing:** No end-to-end coverage measurement
4. **CI/CD Integration:** Coverage not yet automated

### 🚨 **Critical Issues**
1. **Frontend Component Tests:** Systematic failures in complex component testing
2. **Infrastructure Module:** Very low backend coverage in critical areas
3. **Test Maintenance:** Many tests don't match actual component implementations
