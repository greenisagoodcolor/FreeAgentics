## 📊 Executive Summary

| Metric | Backend (Python) | Frontend (TS/JS) | Combined |
|--------|------------------|------------------|----------|
| **Lines** | 18.65% | ~2-5%* | ~13-15% |
| **Statements** | 18.65% | ~2-5%* | ~13-15% |
| **Branches** | ~15-20% | ~1-3%* | ~10-12% |
| **Functions** | ~20-25% | ~1-3%* | ~12-15% |

**Overall Project Coverage: ~13-15%**

*Frontend coverage is low due to systematic test failures (not configuration issues)

## 🐍 Backend Coverage (Python)

### Current Status
- **Total Statements:** 27,340
- **Covered Statements:** 6,177 (18.65%)
- **Total Branches:** 9,989
- **Test Command:** `python3 -m pytest --cov=api --cov=agents --cov=coalitions --cov=inference --cov=knowledge --cov=infrastructure --cov=world --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=term`

### Module-Level Breakdown
| Module | Coverage | Priority | Target |
|--------|----------|----------|---------|
| **API** | 84% | ✅ Good | Maintain 80%+ |
| **Agents.Base** | 21% | ⚠️ Medium | 60% |
| **Coalitions** | ~15-20% | ❌ High | 70% |
| **Inference** | ~15-20% | ❌ High | 75% |

## 🌐 Frontend Coverage (TypeScript/JavaScript)

### Current Status
- **Total Test Suites:** 79
- **Passing Tests:** 5 (1 suite)
- **Skipped Tests:** 1,899 (78 suites)
- **Test Command:** `npm test -- --coverage --watchAll=false`

### Component-Level Breakdown
| Area | Coverage | Priority | Target |
|------|----------|----------|---------|
| **Components** | 1.68% | ❌ Critical | 70% |
| **Hooks** | 2.63% | ⚠️ Medium | 80% |
| **Lib Modules** | 3.42% | ⚠️ Medium | 75% |
| **App Pages** | 18.6% | ⚠️ Medium | 60% |
| **Contexts** | 8.75% | ⚠️ Medium | 70% |

### Key Issues Resolved
- ✅ Fixed ESM module issues with `lodash-es` by mapping to `lodash`
- ✅ Excluded setup and helper files from test collection
- ✅ Established working Jest configuration

### Improvement Targets
1. **Short-term (Q1 2025):** Fix remaining test suites to run (currently 78 skipped)
2. **Medium-term (Q2 2025):** Achieve 50% component coverage
3. **Long-term (Q3 2025):** Reach 70% overall frontend coverage

|------------|-------|--------|
| **🔴 Critical** | Infrastructure, Core Components | System stability |
| **🟡 Medium** | Business Logic, UI Components | Feature reliability |
| **🟢 Low** | API endpoints, Individual hooks | Isolated failures |

### Coverage Goals by Quarter
| Quarter | Backend Target | Frontend Target | Combined Target |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Q1 2025** | 40% | 25% | 35% |
| **Q2 2025** | 60% | 50% | 55% |
| **Q3 2025** | 80% | 70% | 75% |

## 📈 Tracking & Monitoring

### Coverage Commands
```bash
# Backend Coverage
python3 -m pytest --cov=api --cov=agents --cov=coalitions --cov=inference --cov=knowledge --cov=infrastructure --cov=world --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html

# Frontend Coverage
cd web && npm test -- --coverage --watchAll=false

# Combined Report Generation
./scripts/generate-coverage-report.sh
```

### Metrics to Track
- [ ] Line coverage percentage
- [ ] Branch coverage percentage
- [ ] Function coverage percentage
- [ ] Test execution time
- [ ] Number of skipped tests

## 🔧 Technical Notes

### Backend Testing
- Use `python3 -m pytest` (not just `pytest`) to avoid import issues
- Coverage includes: api, agents, coalitions, inference, knowledge, infrastructure, world
- One test file still has import issues but doesn't affect overall coverage

### Frontend Testing
- Jest configuration fixed for ESM modules
- Setup and helper files excluded from test collection
- Coverage thresholds set to 50% (currently not met)

### Known Issues
- [ ] 78 frontend test suites currently skipped
- [ ] Some backend modules have very low coverage (<10%)
- [ ] No integration test coverage measurement
