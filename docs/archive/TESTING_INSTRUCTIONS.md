# Testing the Unified Development Environment

## Quick Test Instructions

Follow these steps to test the new unified development environment:

### 1. Clone and Setup (60 seconds)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/greenisagoodcolor/FreeAgentics.git
cd FreeAgentics

# Install dependencies (Python + Node.js)
make install
```

### 2. Start in Demo Mode (No External Dependencies)

```bash
# Start the development environment
make dev
```

**What to expect:**

- You'll see: `ðŸŽ¯ Provider Mode: DEMO`
- Backend starts on http://localhost:8000
- Frontend starts on http://localhost:3000
- No database or API keys required!

### 3. Verify Demo Mode Works

#### Test 1: Check Dev Configuration

```bash
# In a new terminal, get the dev config
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/dev-config | jq
```

**Expected output:**

```json
{
  "mode": "demo",
  "auth": {
    "token": "eyJ...",  // Auto-generated token
    "user": {
      "role": "admin",
      "permissions": ["create_agent", "view_agents", ...]
    }
  },
  "message": "ðŸŽ¯ Running in demo mode..."
}
```

#### Test 2: Use the API with Auto Token

```bash
# Extract the token
TOKEN=$(curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/v1/dev-config | jq -r .auth.token)

# List agents (should work without manual auth setup!)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8000/api/v1/agents
```

**Expected:** `[]` (empty array)

#### Test 3: Create an Agent

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/agents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test Agent",
    "template": "basic-explorer",
    "parameters": {"description": "My first agent"}
  }'
```

**Expected:** Returns created agent with ID

#### Test 4: Frontend UI

1. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
2. The UI should load without authentication errors
3. You should be able to create and view agents

### 4. Progressive Enhancement Tests

#### Add a Real Database

```bash
# Stop the current dev server (Ctrl+C)

# Set database URL (SQLite file)
export DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///test.db

# Restart
make dev
```

**What changes:**

- You'll see: `ðŸ”§ Provider Mode: DEVELOPMENT`
- Data persists between restarts
- Auth is required (no auto-token)

#### Add Redis

```bash
# If you have Redis running locally
export REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
make dev
```

**What changes:**

- Rate limiting uses Redis instead of memory
- Better performance under load

### 5. Verify Tests Pass

```bash
# Run the new unified dev mode tests
pytest tests/unit/test_unified_dev_mode.py -v

# Run integration tests
pytest tests/integration/test_dev_mode_e2e.py -v

# Run quick development tests
make test-dev
```

### 6. Key Things to Verify

âœ… **No 403 Errors in Demo Mode**

- All API endpoints should work with the auto-generated token
- No manual authentication setup required

âœ… **Clean Provider Detection**

- Check the console output shows correct provider mode
- Verify SQLite is used when no DATABASE_URL

âœ… **Frontend Works Immediately**

- UI loads without configuration
- Can create/view agents without setup

âœ… **Same Code Paths**

- No special "demo mode" bypasses
- Just different provider implementations

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Port Already in Use**

```bash
# The dev script auto-cleans ports, but if needed:
make kill-ports
```

**Module Import Errors**

```bash
# Ensure you ran install
make install
```

**Frontend Not Starting**

```bash
# Check web directory
cd web && npm install
```

### What Success Looks Like

1. âœ… Single `make dev` command starts everything
2. âœ… No authentication setup needed in demo mode
3. âœ… API endpoints return data, not 403 errors
4. âœ… Frontend connects and shows agents
5. âœ… Clear logs showing which providers are active

### Cleanup

```bash
# Stop all services
make stop

# Remove test database (if created)
rm -f test.db

# Full reset
make reset
```

## Report Results

Please test and report:

1. Did `make dev` work on first try?
2. Could you access the API without auth setup?
3. Did the frontend load and work?
4. Any errors or confusion points?

The goal is "clone â†’ make install â†’ make dev â†’ working UI" with zero configuration!
