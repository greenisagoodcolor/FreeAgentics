## Questions & Discussion (10 minutes)

### Anticipated Questions

**Q: "How does this compare to existing AI systems?"**
A: "Traditional AI learns from data. Active Inference agents model their environment and minimize uncertainty - more like how biological intelligence works. This leads to better generalization and interpretability."

**Q: "What's the commercial timeline?"**
A: "We have a working system today. With continued development, we could have commercial pilots within 6 months, production deployment within 12 months."

**Q: "What are the main technical risks?"**
A: "Scaling performance and building enterprise features. The core science is proven - it's an engineering challenge now."

**Q: "How much more investment is needed?"**
A: "6 months of focused development to reach commercial viability. The foundation is strong - we're building features, not starting over."

### Key Messages to Reinforce

1. **This is real technology, not vaporware**
2. **We've solved the hard scientific problems**  
3. **The demo shows genuine capability, not smoke and mirrors**
