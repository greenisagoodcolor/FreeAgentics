# FreeAgentics Testing Strategy
## Development Cycle-Based Testing Hierarchy

### Overview
This testing strategy aligns with the development cycle, providing clear guidance on when to run tests and what they should achieve. Each test tier has a specific purpose, execution time, and quality gate.

## Testing Tiers

### 🚀 Tier 1: Developer Tests (Fast Feedback Loop)
**Purpose**: Immediate feedback during feature development  
**When**: Before every commit, during active development  
**Target Time**: < 30 seconds  
**Coverage Target**: 60%+ unit tests

#### What's Included:
- Unit tests for current module being worked on
- Key integration tests (critical paths only)
- Type checking for modified files
- Basic linting

#### Commands:
```bash
make test-dev          # Fast developer feedback loop
make test-dev-watch    # Continuous testing during development
```

### 🎯 Tier 2: Feature Tests (Feature Completion)
**Purpose**: Validate complete feature functionality  
**When**: Before feature branch merge, milestone completion  
**Target Time**: < 5 minutes  
**Coverage Target**: 80%+ including integration tests

#### What's Included:
- All unit tests for affected modules
- Integration tests for the feature
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Property-based tests for mathematical invariants
- Full type checking and linting

#### Commands:
```bash
make test-feature      # Complete feature validation
make test-milestone    # Milestone completion verification
```

### 🚢 Tier 3: Release Tests (Production Readiness)
**Purpose**: Ensure production readiness and system stability  
**When**: Before releases, weekly quality checks  
**Target Time**: < 15 minutes  
**Coverage Target**: 90%+ including all test types

#### What's Included:
- Complete test suite (unit + integration + e2e)
- Security tests (OWASP, vulnerability scanning)
- Performance tests and benchmarks
- Chaos engineering tests
- Contract tests (API backwards compatibility)
- Compliance tests (ADR validation)
- Visual regression tests

#### Commands:
```bash
make test-release      # Full production readiness check
make test-production   # Pre-deployment validation
```

### 🔍 Tier 4: Continuous Tests (Quality Assurance)
**Purpose**: Ongoing quality monitoring and regression detection  
**When**: Nightly, on CI/CD, scheduled runs  
**Target Time**: < 30 minutes  
**Coverage Target**: 95%+ with comprehensive reporting

#### What's Included:
- All Tier 3 tests plus extended scenarios
- Stress tests and load testing
- Memory leak detection
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Code quality metrics and technical debt analysis
- Comprehensive reporting and metrics

#### Commands:
```bash
make test-continuous   # Complete quality assurance suite
make test-nightly      # Scheduled comprehensive testing
```

## Test Categories by Type

### Core Test Types:
- **Unit Tests**: Individual module/function testing
- **Integration Tests**: Module interaction testing
- **Property Tests**: Mathematical invariant validation (ADR-007)
- **Behavior Tests**: BDD scenario testing
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete user workflow testing

### Quality Assurance Tests:
- **Security Tests**: OWASP, vulnerability scanning
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmarks, load testing
- **Chaos Tests**: Failure injection and resilience
- **Contract Tests**: API backwards compatibility
- **Compliance Tests**: Architecture decision record validation

### Visual & UX Tests:
- **Visual Tests**: Screenshot comparison, UI regression
- **Accessibility Tests**: WCAG compliance
- **User Experience Tests**: Interaction flow validation

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Test Organization:
```
tests/
├── unit/           # Tier 1 & 2 - Fast unit tests
├── integration/    # Tier 2 & 3 - Module interaction tests
├── e2e/           # Tier 2 & 3 - User workflow tests
├── property/      # Tier 2 & 3 - Mathematical invariants
├── behavior/      # Tier 2 & 3 - BDD scenarios
├── security/      # Tier 3 & 4 - Security validation
├── performance/   # Tier 3 & 4 - Performance benchmarks
├── chaos/         # Tier 3 & 4 - Resilience testing
├── contract/      # Tier 3 & 4 - API compatibility
├── compliance/    # Tier 3 & 4 - ADR validation
└── visual/        # Tier 3 & 4 - UI regression
```

### 2. pytest Marks for Test Selection:
```python
@pytest.mark.unit        # Fast unit tests
@pytest.mark.integration # Module interaction tests
@pytest.mark.e2e        # End-to-end workflows
@pytest.mark.property   # Mathematical invariants
@pytest.mark.security   # Security tests
@pytest.mark.performance # Performance benchmarks
@pytest.mark.slow       # Long-running tests
@pytest.mark.critical   # Critical path tests
```

### 3. Execution Time Targets:
- **Unit tests**: < 1 second per test
- **Integration tests**: < 5 seconds per test
- **E2E tests**: < 30 seconds per test
- **Property tests**: < 10 seconds per test
- **Security tests**: < 60 seconds total
- **Performance tests**: Variable based on benchmark

## Development Workflow Integration

### Daily Development:
1. **Start**: `make test-dev-watch` (continuous feedback)
2. **Before commit**: `make test-dev` (fast validation)
3. **Feature complete**: `make test-feature` (comprehensive validation)

### Feature Branch Workflow:
1. **Feature development**: Tier 1 tests
2. **Feature integration**: Tier 2 tests
3. **Pull request**: Tier 2 tests + code review
4. **Merge to main**: Tier 3 tests (automated)

### Release Workflow:
1. **Release candidate**: Tier 3 tests
2. **Pre-production**: Tier 4 tests
3. **Production deployment**: Tier 3 validation
4. **Post-deployment**: Tier 4 monitoring

## Reporting and Metrics

### Per-Tier Reporting:
- **Tier 1**: Simple pass/fail with error details
- **Tier 2**: Coverage report + test results summary
- **Tier 3**: Comprehensive report with all metrics
- **Tier 4**: Full quality dashboard with trends

### Key Metrics:
- Test execution time by tier
- Coverage percentage by module
- Test reliability (flakiness)
- Performance benchmark trends
- Security issue trends
- Technical debt metrics

This strategy ensures that developers get fast feedback during development while maintaining high quality standards for releases.
