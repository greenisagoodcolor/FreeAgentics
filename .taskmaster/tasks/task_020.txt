# Task ID: 20
# Title: Implement Advanced Performance Validation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 16, 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Validate multi-agent coordination performance limits and optimize memory usage based on load testing findings
# Details:
1. Document actual multi-agent coordination limits based on load testing (currently 28.4% efficiency at 50 agents). 2. Investigate and optimize the 72% efficiency loss at scale identified in load testing. 3. Profile memory usage to understand the 34.5MB per agent limit and optimize where possible. 4. Implement connection pooling and resource management for WebSocket connections. 5. Optimize PostgreSQL queries and implement proper indexing for multi-agent scenarios. 6. Test and tune garbage collection settings for memory optimization. 7. Implement agent lifecycle management to prevent resource leaks. 8. Create performance benchmarks that can be run in CI/CD to catch regressions.

# Test Strategy:
Use profiling tools like cProfile, memory_profiler, and performance monitoring to identify bottlenecks. Run load tests with increasing agent counts to validate optimization effectiveness. Compare before/after performance metrics to ensure improvements. Implement automated performance regression tests in CI/CD pipeline.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Document Performance Limits and Create Benchmarks [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Compile comprehensive documentation of multi-agent coordination limits and create automated performance benchmarks
### Details:
Document the identified 28.4% efficiency at 50 agents and 72% efficiency loss at scale. Create performance benchmark suite that tests agent scaling (10, 25, 50, 100 agents), memory usage patterns, WebSocket connection limits, and database query performance. Implement benchmarks as pytest fixtures that can be integrated into CI/CD pipeline. Include threshold alerts for performance regressions.
