The multi-agent scaling approach is architecturally impossible under current Python implementation.

This violated the fundamental principle of measuring actual operations. Framework redesigned with strict enforcement: 1) Hard failure mode when PyMDP unavailable - no fallbacks or simulated timing, 2) Complete removal of all time.sleep() calls from benchmark code, 3) Dependency validation that prevents benchmark execution if real PyMDP components cannot be imported, 4) Benchmark suite now fails fast and explicitly rather than producing fake results.

The benchmark framework was compromised by time.sleep() fallbacks that created performance theater instead of authentic measurements. Complete redesign enforced with: 1) Hard failure mode - benchmarks terminate immediately if PyMDP dependencies unavailable, no graceful degradation to fake results, 2) Complete elimination of all time.sleep() calls from benchmark codebase - if real PyMDP operation cannot be measured, benchmark does not execute, 3) Dependency validation gate - framework performs strict import verification before any benchmark execution, failing fast with explicit error messages, 4) Zero tolerance policy for mock implementations or simulated timing - all measurements must reflect genuine PyMDP computational operations.
