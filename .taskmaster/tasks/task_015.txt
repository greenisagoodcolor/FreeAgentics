# Task ID: 15
# Title: Validate Production Deployment Infrastructure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Test and validate Docker containers, database configurations, and deployment scripts for production readiness
# Details:
1. Build and test Docker containers in production configuration with multi-stage builds. 2. Test PostgreSQL and Redis with production-level data volumes and connection pooling. 3. Implement SSL/TLS certificate management with automatic renewal. 4. Create zero-downtime deployment scripts using blue-green or rolling deployment strategies. 5. Implement proper secrets management using environment variables or secret management systems. 6. Test monitoring and alerting systems (Prometheus, Grafana, etc.) under production load. 7. Create and test backup procedures for databases and application state. 8. Implement disaster recovery procedures with RTO/RPO targets. 9. Test rollback procedures.

# Test Strategy:
Deploy to staging environment that mirrors production. Test deployment scripts with simulated production data volumes. Verify zero-downtime deployment by monitoring service availability during updates. Test backup and restore procedures with actual data. Validate monitoring alerts trigger correctly under various failure scenarios. Perform disaster recovery drills.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Validate Docker Container Production Build [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build and test Docker containers with production-optimized multi-stage builds, ensuring minimal image size and security hardening
### Details:
Configure multi-stage Dockerfiles to minimize final image size. Implement security best practices including non-root user execution, minimal base images (alpine/distroless), and removal of unnecessary packages. Test container startup times, resource limits, and health checks. Validate that all production environment variables are properly handled and that secrets are not baked into images.
