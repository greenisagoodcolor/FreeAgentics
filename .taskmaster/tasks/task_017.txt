# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Production Performance Monitoring
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 15
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate real-time performance metrics with monitoring stack and implement alerting for performance degradation
# Details:
1. Integrate existing performance metrics with production monitoring stack (Prometheus/Grafana). 2. Implement real-time alerting for performance degradation using AlertManager. 3. Create capacity planning documentation with actual performance limits (50 agent coordination limit). 4. Monitor and optimize memory usage targeting <34.5MB per agent. 5. Implement distributed tracing for multi-agent coordination bottlenecks. 6. Set up performance regression detection in CI/CD pipeline. 7. Create performance dashboards showing key metrics: agent coordination efficiency, memory usage per agent, API response times. 8. Document performance baselines and acceptable thresholds.

# Test Strategy:
Load test the monitoring system itself to ensure it can handle production metrics volume. Validate that alerts trigger correctly when performance thresholds are breached. Test performance regression detection by introducing known performance issues. Verify that monitoring data is accurate by comparing with manual measurements.

# Subtasks:
