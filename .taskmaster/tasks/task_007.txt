Repository cleanup requirements for agent inference metrics infrastructure:

Remove obsolete metrics collection files including old inference metrics versions (inference-metrics-v1.py, backup_metrics.py), deprecated instrumentation files, unused metrics configuration files, and outdated test reports and monitoring result archives.

Consolidate metrics collection directories by merging duplicate metrics setup scripts into single authoritative versions, removing redundant instrumentation files across multiple directories, consolidating metrics documentation into unified inference monitoring guide, and deleting obsolete metrics utilities and deprecated collection helper scripts.

Clean up metrics collection artifacts including old inference metrics logs, token usage tracking artifacts, obsolete latency reports, success rate analysis files, deprecated metrics results, outdated error pattern logs, and obsolete metrics configuration validation files.

Reduce technical debt by deleting unused metrics models and deprecated instrumentation definitions, removing obsolete metrics collection managers and legacy monitoring code, cleaning up metrics artifacts that are no longer applicable, and updating metrics documentation to reflect current inference monitoring only.

This cleanup ensures the agent inference metrics infrastructure remains clean and focused without legacy artifacts that could cause confusion during observability integration development.
