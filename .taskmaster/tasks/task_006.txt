# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Validate JWT and RBAC implementation under production load conditions

<info added on 2025-07-14T10:22:53.395Z>
Add comprehensive cleanup requirements for JWT lifecycle testing infrastructure including systematic removal of obsolete test files (jwt-test-v1.py, backup_jwt.py, deprecated validation files), consolidation of duplicate JWT testing directories and setup scripts, cleanup of test artifacts (logs, reports, validation files), and technical debt reduction through deletion of unused JWT models and legacy authentication code to maintain clean focused testing environment.

## 2. Implement concurrent authentication load tests [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create load tests to verify authentication system performance under concurrent user scenarios
### Details:
Design tests simulating multiple concurrent login attempts, token refreshes, and session management. Use tools like k6 or JMeter to generate load. Test system behavior under various concurrency levels (100, 1000, 10000 users)
<info added on 2025-07-14T10:23:22.559Z>
Pre-testing cleanup phase for authentication load testing infrastructure:

1. Audit and remove obsolete load test files including deprecated versions (auth-load-v1.py, backup_load.py) and outdated concurrent testing utilities
2. Consolidate scattered load test directories by merging duplicate setup scripts and removing redundant concurrent testing files across multiple locations
3. Clean up accumulated load test artifacts including old logs, token refresh reports, session management analysis files, and deprecated concurrency level results
4. Reduce technical debt by removing unused load test models, obsolete authentication load managers, and legacy stress testing code that could interfere with current testing infrastructure
5. Update load testing documentation to reflect only current authentication performance testing capabilities after cleanup completion

This systematic cleanup ensures the concurrent authentication load testing environment (targeting 100, 1000, 10000 user levels with k6/JMeter) operates with clean, focused infrastructure without legacy artifacts that could cause confusion or conflicts during load test execution.

## 3. Test RBAC permissions at scale [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Verify role-based access control functionality and performance with large permission sets
### Details:
Create test scenarios with complex role hierarchies, multiple permission combinations, and large user bases. Test permission inheritance, role conflicts, and authorization decision performance. Verify correct access control across all endpoints
<info added on 2025-07-14T10:23:50.792Z>
Additional cleanup requirements for RBAC permissions testing infrastructure:

SYSTEMATIC REPOSITORY CLEANUP:
- Remove obsolete RBAC test files: rbac-test-v1.py, backup_rbac.py, deprecated role hierarchy files, outdated permission testing utilities, unused RBAC configuration files, permission combination parameters, obsolete test reports and authorization result archives
- Consolidate RBAC test directories: merge duplicate testing setup scripts into single authoritative versions, remove redundant permission testing files across multiple directories, consolidate RBAC documentation into unified authorization testing guide, delete obsolete utilities and deprecated role helper scripts
- Clean up RBAC test artifacts: remove old test logs, permission verification artifacts, obsolete role hierarchy reports, permission inheritance analysis files, deprecated RBAC results, outdated authorization decision logs, obsolete configuration validation files
- Technical debt reduction: delete unused RBAC models, deprecated permission testing definitions, obsolete RBAC managers, legacy authorization code, clean up non-applicable RBAC artifacts, update documentation to reflect current authorization testing only

This comprehensive cleanup ensures the RBAC permissions testing infrastructure remains clean and focused without legacy artifacts that could cause confusion during complex role hierarchy and permission combination testing implementation.

## 4. Add rate limiting verification tests [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement tests to verify rate limiting functionality prevents abuse and DoS attacks
### Details:
Test rate limiting on authentication endpoints, API calls, and resource-intensive operations. Verify proper rate limit headers, retry-after responses, and distributed rate limiting if applicable. Test bypass attempts and edge cases
