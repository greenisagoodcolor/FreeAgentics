# Task ID: 19
# Title: Create Production Operational Documentation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 17
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop comprehensive runbooks, incident response procedures, and user documentation for production operations
# Details:
1. Create production runbooks covering: deployment procedures, common troubleshooting scenarios, system recovery procedures. 2. Document incident response procedures with escalation paths and communication templates. 3. Implement user onboarding documentation with screenshots and step-by-step guides. 4. Create comprehensive API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger with real examples and authentication details. 5. Establish monitoring dashboards for operations team with key metrics and alerts. 6. Document system architecture with component diagrams and data flow. 7. Create troubleshooting guides for common user issues. 8. Document backup and disaster recovery procedures.

# Test Strategy:
Review documentation with operations team and gather feedback. Test runbooks by having team members follow procedures without additional guidance. Validate API documentation by having external developers use it to integrate. Test user onboarding documentation with actual new users and measure completion rates.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Production Runbooks and Deployment Documentation [done]
### Dependencies: None

COMPREHENSIVE CLEANUP REQUIREMENTS ADDED: Remove obsolete health check files including deprecated health check scripts, outdated smoke test suites, legacy endpoint validators, and redundant health check configurations. Consolidate health check infrastructure by merging scattered health check modules, unifying endpoint validation logic, consolidating smoke test suites, and standardizing health check documentation. Clean up health check artifacts by removing failed health check logs, deleting temporary test results, cleaning up deprecated health status files, and removing obsolete monitoring scripts. Reduce technical debt by eliminating duplicate health check implementations, removing redundant smoke tests, consolidating overlapping validation logic, and archiving historical health check data. This cleanup ensures pristine production health check infrastructure for venture capitalist demonstration.
