# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Test Coverage
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Achieve minimum 70% test coverage across all modules with focus on zero-coverage GNN modules
# Details:
1. Audit current test coverage using coverage.py or similar tools. 2. Focus on GNN modules that currently have 0% coverage - create unit tests for graph neural network operations. 3. Write integration tests for multi-agent coordination and communication. 4. Implement end-to-end user scenario testing covering complete user workflows. 5. Create chaos engineering tests using tools like Chaos Monkey to validate system resilience. 6. Test error handling and recovery mechanisms with fault injection. 7. Validate exception handling in all critical code paths. 8. Ensure tests cover edge cases and boundary conditions.

# Test Strategy:
Use pytest with coverage.py to measure and validate 70% minimum coverage. Implement property-based testing for complex algorithms. Create integration test suite that validates multi-component interactions. Use chaos engineering tools to test system resilience under various failure conditions. Validate that error handling works correctly by injecting faults.
