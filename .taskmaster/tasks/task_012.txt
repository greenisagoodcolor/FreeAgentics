# Task ID: 12
# Title: Validate PyMDP Active Inference Functionality
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Remove graceful fallback patterns and implement hard failure mode for missing PyMDP dependencies to validate actual Active Inference operations
# Details:
1. Audit current PyMDP integration code to identify all graceful fallback patterns. 2. Remove try/catch blocks that silently fail when PyMDP unavailable. 3. Implement hard failure with clear error messages when dependencies missing. 4. Create functional tests that verify: belief state updates work with real data, policy computation executes properly, action selection operates correctly. 5. Test with actual PyMDP library calls, not mocks. 6. Validate installation in production environment. 7. Create integration test suite that fails if Active Inference is not functional.

# Test Strategy:
Create comprehensive integration tests that make actual PyMDP calls and verify belief state updates, policy computation, and action selection. Tests must fail hard if PyMDP is not properly installed or functional. Include tests with real data scenarios and validate that all Active Inference operations complete successfully without fallbacks.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Audit and Remove Graceful Fallback Patterns [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Systematically identify and remove all try/catch blocks and conditional imports that allow the system to continue without PyMDP
### Details:
Search for patterns like 'try: import pymdp except:', 'if HAS_PYMDP:', and mock implementations. Document all fallback locations in agents/, inference/, and related modules. Remove unnecessary abstraction layers and simplify import structure. Clean up any orphaned mock objects or placeholder classes that were used as PyMDP substitutes.

## 2. Implement Hard Failure Modes with Clear Error Messages [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
