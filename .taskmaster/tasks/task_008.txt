# Task ID: 8
# Title: Fix Type System and Lint Compliance
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Resolve remaining MyPy type errors and code quality issues
# Details:
Fix remaining MyPy type annotations. Resolve flake8 violations. Update TypeScript interfaces for consistency. Fix import ordering and unused variable issues. Ensure code quality standards for production deployment. Based on current assessment: syntax errors have been resolved allowing mypy to run, but significant work remains with 10,756 flake8 violations, TypeScript compilation errors, and missing pre-commit configuration.

# Test Strategy:
Run MyPy with zero errors. Pass all linting checks. Verify TypeScript compilation without warnings.

# Subtasks:
## 5. Resolve 10,756 flake8 violations systematically [done]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Address the massive backlog of flake8 violations identified in the current codebase assessment
### Details:
Based on TASK_8_STATUS_REPORT.md, there are 10,756 flake8 violations that need systematic resolution. Prioritize violations by severity and impact, focusing on critical issues first (unused imports, syntax errors, security issues) before addressing style violations. Break down the work into manageable chunks by module or violation type to ensure steady progress.

## 6. Fix TypeScript compilation errors [done]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Resolve TypeScript compilation errors preventing successful builds
### Details:
Address TypeScript compilation errors identified in the assessment. Review and fix type mismatches, missing imports, and syntax errors in TypeScript files. Ensure all TypeScript code compiles without warnings or errors.

## 7. Create missing pre-commit configuration file [done]
### Dependencies: 8.4
### Description: Implement the missing .pre-commit-config.yaml file based on completed cleanup work
### Details:
Create the .pre-commit-config.yaml file that was cleaned up but is now missing. Configure appropriate hooks for mypy, flake8, and TypeScript based on the current project structure and requirements. Test that all hooks execute properly.

## 1. Resolve MyPy type annotation errors [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Run MyPy type checker and fix all type annotation errors in the codebase
### Details:
Execute mypy command to identify type errors, then systematically fix each error by adding proper type annotations, fixing type mismatches, and ensuring all functions and variables have appropriate type hints

COMPREHENSIVE CLEANUP REQUIREMENTS ADDED:
Investigation and continuous repository tidying through systematic scan and technical debt reduction focusing on type annotation infrastructure:

1. Remove obsolete type stub files:
   - Delete old type stub versions (.pyi files that are outdated)
   - Remove deprecated type definition files and outdated mypy configuration
   - Clean up unused type override files and legacy type ignore comments
   - Delete obsolete type checking reports and mypy result archives

2. Consolidate type annotation directories:
   - Merge duplicate type stub files into single authoritative versions
   - Remove redundant type definition files across multiple directories
   - Consolidate type documentation into unified typing guide
   - Delete obsolete type utilities and deprecated annotation helper scripts

3. Clean up type checking artifacts:
   - Remove old mypy cache directories (.mypy_cache)
   - Delete obsolete type error logs and annotation tracking artifacts
   - Clean up deprecated type checking results and outdated error reports
   - Remove obsolete type configuration validation files

4. Technical debt reduction:
   - Delete unused type models and deprecated annotation definitions
   - Remove obsolete type checking scripts and legacy validation code
   - Clean up type artifacts that are no longer applicable
   - Update type documentation to reflect current annotation standards only

This cleanup ensures type annotation infrastructure remains clean and focused without legacy artifacts that could cause confusion during type system compliance development.

## 2. Fix flake8 style violations and imports [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Run flake8 linter and resolve all style violations and import issues
### Details:
Execute flake8 to identify style violations including line length, whitespace, import ordering, and unused imports. Fix each violation to ensure code adheres to PEP 8 standards

   - Delete old flake8 configuration versions (.flake8.old, backup-flake8)
   - Remove deprecated style checking files and outdated linting utilities
   - Clean up unused style override files and legacy noqa comments
   - Delete obsolete linting reports and flake8 result archives

2. Consolidate linting directories:
   - Merge duplicate linting configuration files into single authoritative versions
   - Remove redundant style guide files across multiple directories
   - Consolidate linting documentation into unified style guide
   - Delete obsolete linting utilities and deprecated style helper scripts

3. Clean up linting artifacts:
   - Remove old linting cache directories and temporary files
   - Delete obsolete style violation logs and linting tracking artifacts
   - Clean up deprecated flake8 results and outdated violation reports
   - Remove obsolete linting configuration validation files

4. Technical debt reduction:
   - Delete unused linting plugins and deprecated style definitions
   - Remove obsolete style checking scripts and legacy validation code
   - Clean up linting artifacts that are no longer applicable
   - Update style documentation to reflect current PEP 8 standards only

This cleanup ensures code style compliance infrastructure remains clean and focused without legacy artifacts that could cause confusion during flake8 violation resolution.
