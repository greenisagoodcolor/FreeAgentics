# Task ID: 21
# Title: Validate Production Environment Configuration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 14, 15, 18, 19
# Priority: high
# Description: Final validation of complete production environment including monitoring, security, and performance under real-world conditions
# Details:
1. Deploy complete system to production-like staging environment. 2. Run full end-to-end validation with real user scenarios and data volumes. 3. Validate that all monitoring and alerting systems work correctly in production configuration. 4. Test SSL/TLS certificates and security configurations. 5. Validate backup and disaster recovery procedures work correctly. 6. Test zero-downtime deployment procedures. 7. Verify API response times meet <200ms 95th percentile requirement. 8. Validate system uptime targets of >99.9% through extended testing. 9. Confirm MTTR <30 minutes and incident detection <5 minutes through simulated incidents.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct extended stress testing over multiple days to validate stability. Simulate various failure scenarios to test monitoring and recovery procedures. Use external monitoring services to validate uptime and response times. Perform security penetration testing in production-like environment. Test with real user load patterns and data.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Code Cleanup and Dead Code Removal [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Perform comprehensive code cleanup to remove all dead code, unused dependencies, and development artifacts
### Details:
1. Scan entire codebase for unused imports, functions, and variables using automated tools. 2. Remove all commented-out code blocks and TODO/FIXME comments that are no longer relevant. 3. Eliminate unused dependencies from requirements files and package managers. 4. Remove all development/debug code including console.logs, print statements, and debug flags. 5. Clean up test files to remove skipped/disabled tests and obsolete test data. 6. Remove any experimental or proof-of-concept code not used in production. 7. Eliminate duplicate code through refactoring and consolidation. 8. Remove all temporary files, cache directories, and build artifacts. 9. Clean up configuration files to remove development-only settings.

## 2. Directory Structure Optimization [done]
### Dependencies: 21.1
### Description: Reorganize repository structure for clarity, maintainability, and professional presentation
### Details:
1. Consolidate related modules into logical directory hierarchies following industry best practices. 2. Separate production code from development/test code with clear boundaries. 3. Create proper package structure with __init__.py files and clear module exports. 4. Move all configuration files to a dedicated config directory with environment-specific subdirectories. 5. Organize documentation into a structured docs/ directory with API docs, architecture diagrams, and deployment guides. 6. Consolidate all scripts into appropriate directories (scripts/, tools/, or bin/). 7. Ensure all third-party dependencies are properly vendored or documented. 8. Create clear separation between frontend and backend code if applicable. 9. Remove any nested git repositories or submodules that complicate the structure.
