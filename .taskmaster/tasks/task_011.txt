# Task ID: 11
# Title: Fix 30 Failing LLM Local Manager Tests
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Resolve Mock object issues and provider initialization problems causing 30 test failures in test_llm_local_manager.py
# Details:
Analyze test_llm_local_manager.py to identify root causes of failures. Fix Mock object configuration issues - ensure proper return_value and side_effect settings for async methods. Resolve provider initialization problems by properly mocking provider factory methods and configuration. Update test fixtures to match current LLM manager implementation. Fix async/await test patterns and ensure proper cleanup in tearDown methods. Address any missing mock attributes or incorrect mock call assertions. Verify mock patch targets match actual import paths. Update tests to handle new error conditions or API changes in LLM manager. Ensure all mocked dependencies (config, providers, clients) are properly initialized before tests run.

# Test Strategy:
Run pytest test_llm_local_manager.py -v to verify all 30 tests pass. Check for any remaining deprecation warnings or async warnings. Verify mocks are properly reset between tests. Run tests in isolation to ensure no inter-test dependencies. Validate test coverage remains at or above current levels. Run full test suite to ensure no regression in other modules.

# Subtasks:
