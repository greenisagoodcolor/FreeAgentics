# Task ID: 13
# Title: Fix All Pre-commit Quality Gates
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Resolve all disabled pre-commit hooks and fix underlying code quality issues to ensure proper CI/CD pipeline
# Details:
1. Fix JSON syntax errors including duplicate timezone keys and malformed bandit security reports. 2. Resolve YAML syntax errors in GitHub workflows, particularly template literal issues. 3. Address all flake8 violations without using ignore flags for critical checks. 4. Configure and fix radon complexity analysis to pass complexity thresholds. 5. Implement safety dependency scanning for known vulnerabilities. 6. Fix ESLint and Prettier configurations for frontend code quality. 7. Remove all SKIP environment variable overrides from pre-commit configuration. 8. Ensure all hooks pass or fail properly without workarounds.

# Test Strategy:
Run pre-commit hooks locally and in CI/CD pipeline without any SKIP overrides. Verify that all hooks pass consistently. Test by making intentional code quality violations to ensure hooks properly catch and prevent commits. Validate that the pipeline fails appropriately when code quality standards are not met.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Fix JSON syntax errors and malformed files [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify and fix all JSON syntax errors including duplicate timezone keys, malformed bandit security reports, and any other JSON validation issues across the codebase
### Details:
Scan all JSON files in the repository for syntax errors. Fix duplicate keys in timezone configurations, repair malformed bandit security report structures, validate all JSON files against their schemas where applicable. Remove any commented-out JSON content and ensure proper formatting. Clean up any backup or temporary JSON files that may be cluttering the repository.
