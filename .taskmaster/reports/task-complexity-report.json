		{
			"taskId": 49,
			"taskTitle": "Fix Critical Test Infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the test infrastructure fix into steps for dependency installation, environment configuration, import error resolution, numpy/PyTorch compatibility fixes, test execution validation, and coverage reporting setup. Each subtask should be independently verifiable and contribute to achieving >95% test execution success rate.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple dependency management challenges, environment configuration issues, and compatibility problems between numpy and PyTorch. The high number of failing tests (400) and diverse error types (import errors, array interface failures, device mismatches) require systematic approach. Similar to completed Task 1 which had 10 subtasks for 130 failing tests, this broader scope warrants 6 focused subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 50,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Real Performance Benchmarking",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for removing mock implementations, setting up PyMDP benchmarking infrastructure, implementing memory profiling, creating database performance tests, WebSocket throughput testing, establishing baseline metrics, and creating automated performance regression tests. Focus on real-world scenarios that expose actual system bottlenecks.",
			"reasoning": "Replacing mocked tests with real benchmarks requires deep understanding of PyMDP operations, proper instrumentation setup, and realistic load generation. The task involves multiple system components (PyMDP inference, database, WebSocket) and various metrics (time, memory, throughput). The complexity is high due to the need for accurate measurements and meaningful test scenarios that reflect production usage."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 51,
			"taskTitle": "Fix Multi-Agent Architecture for GIL Limitations",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Design subtasks for analyzing current GIL bottlenecks, evaluating multiprocessing vs threading tradeoffs, implementing process-based agent isolation, designing shared memory architecture, creating inter-process communication protocols, handling agent coordination with minimal overhead, implementing failure recovery mechanisms, and validating performance improvements. Address the critical 72% coordination overhead issue.",
			"reasoning": "This is one of the most complex tasks as it requires fundamental architectural changes to work around Python's GIL limitations. The 72% coordination overhead indicates severe scalability issues. Solutions involve complex multiprocessing patterns, shared memory management, and careful coordination protocol design. Similar architectural refactoring in production systems typically requires extensive planning and testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 52,
			"taskTitle": "Complete Security Implementation Testing",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure subtasks for JWT authentication load testing, RBAC permission validation under stress, automated security scanning setup (OWASP ZAP, Bandit), input sanitization and injection testing, and rate limiting/DoS protection validation. Each subtask should include specific test scenarios and measurable security criteria.",
			"reasoning": "Security testing requires specialized knowledge but follows established patterns. The task involves multiple security layers (authentication, authorization, input validation, rate limiting) but each has well-defined testing methodologies. The complexity is moderate as security tools and frameworks exist, but proper implementation and interpretation of results requires expertise."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 53,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Real Observability Stack",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into PyMDP-observability integration, Prometheus metrics instrumentation, OpenTelemetry distributed tracing setup, Grafana dashboard creation, alerting rule configuration, and end-to-end observability validation. Focus on actionable metrics that reflect agent performance and system health.",
			"reasoning": "Observability integration touches multiple system layers and requires coordination between different tools (Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, Grafana). The complexity comes from properly instrumenting PyMDP operations, creating meaningful metrics, and ensuring distributed tracing works across agent interactions. Similar to completed monitoring tasks but with added complexity of agent-specific metrics."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 54,
			"taskTitle": "Fix Zero-Coverage Critical Modules",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create focused subtasks for GNN module unit tests, LLM module unit tests, infrastructure module integration tests, coalition module tests, test fixture and mock creation, and coverage reporting integration. Prioritize business-critical paths and error handling scenarios for each module.",
			"reasoning": "Writing tests for modules with 0% coverage requires understanding the business logic, creating appropriate test fixtures, and ensuring meaningful coverage. The diversity of modules (GNN, LLM, infrastructure, coalitions) means different testing approaches are needed. Similar to Task 13's comprehensive quality gate fixes, this requires systematic approach to achieve 50% minimum coverage."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 55,
			"taskTitle": "Optimize Memory Usage for Production Scale",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure optimization tasks for memory profiling setup, belief array sparse matrix conversion, object pooling implementation, shared memory segment design, configuration data deduplication, garbage collection tuning, and multi-agent scaling validation. Target reduction from 34.5MB to <10MB per agent.",
			"reasoning": "Memory optimization requires deep profiling, algorithmic changes (sparse matrices), and architectural patterns (object pooling, shared memory). The 70% reduction target (34.5MB to 10MB) is aggressive and requires multiple optimization techniques. The complexity is high due to the need to maintain functionality while drastically reducing memory footprint, similar to performance optimization challenges in Task 20."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 56,
			"taskTitle": "Complete H3 Spatial Integration",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Define subtasks for H3SpatialProcessor core implementation, adaptive resolution algorithm based on agent density, multi-scale analysis across resolutions [5,7,9,11], H3-GNN adjacency matrix generation, and PyMDP spatial integration. Include performance benchmarks for different resolution levels.",
			"reasoning": "H3 integration is well-documented with clear APIs, but requires understanding of hexagonal spatial indexing and multi-resolution analysis. The complexity comes from integrating with both GNN (for adjacency) and PyMDP (for spatial inference). The task is similar in scope to other integration tasks but benefits from H3's mature ecosystem."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 57,
			"taskTitle": "Fix Database Performance and Scalability",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for PostgreSQL test environment setup, connection pool implementation and tuning, query performance analysis with EXPLAIN ANALYZE, index optimization for multi-agent queries, database migration framework setup, and ACID compliance testing. Focus on real-world data volumes and concurrent access patterns.",
			"reasoning": "Database optimization requires understanding of connection pooling formulas, query optimization, and proper indexing strategies. The task involves both infrastructure setup (real PostgreSQL) and performance tuning. Similar complexity to Task 21's production validation but focused on database layer. The need for proper migration management adds additional complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 58,
			"taskTitle": "Create Production Deployment Pipeline",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure pipeline creation into CI/CD workflow setup, quality gate implementation (format, lint, type, security, test, bench), Docker containerization with security scanning, blue-green deployment configuration, health check and rollback mechanisms, monitoring integration, and end-to-end pipeline testing. Ensure each gate properly blocks deployment on failure.",
			"reasoning": "Creating a production-grade CI/CD pipeline involves multiple technologies and quality gates. The complexity comes from integrating various tools, ensuring proper failure handling, and implementing sophisticated deployment patterns (blue-green). Similar to Task 21's production validation but focused on automation. The requirement for comprehensive quality gates and rollback capabilities increases complexity."
