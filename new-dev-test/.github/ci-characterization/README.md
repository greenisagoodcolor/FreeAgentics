# CI Pipeline Characterization Tests

## Purpose

This directory contains characterization tests for our GitHub Actions CI pipeline, following Michael Feathers' methodology for safely refactoring legacy systems.

## Philosophy

Before we can safely refactor the CI pipeline, we must capture its current behavior completely. These tests serve as a safety net to ensure that our refactoring preserves all existing functionality.

## Test Categories

### 1. Workflow Structure Tests

- Job dependencies and execution order
- Environment variable propagation
- Artifact creation and consumption
- Cache behavior and invalidation

### 2. Output Characterization Tests

- Expected artifacts for each job
- Report formats and contents
- Log output patterns
- Success/failure conditions

### 3. Performance Baseline Tests

- Job execution times
- Resource utilization
- Parallel execution behavior
- Cache hit rates

### 4. Integration Tests

- Cross-job data flow
- External service interactions
- Error propagation and handling
- Retry mechanisms

## Usage

```bash
# Run all characterization tests
npm run test:ci-characterization

# Capture current CI behavior baseline
npm run capture:ci-baseline

# Compare current behavior against baseline
npm run compare:ci-behavior

# Validate refactored CI against original
npm run validate:ci-refactor
```

## Committee Consensus

This approach follows the NEMESIS Committee decision:

- **Michael Feathers**: Comprehensive legacy system characterization
- **Martin Fowler**: Safe refactoring with behavior preservation
- **Kent Beck**: Test-driven approach to CI evolution
- **Robert Martin**: Clean separation of testing concerns
