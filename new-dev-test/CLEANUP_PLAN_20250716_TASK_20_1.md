# Cleanup Plan for Task 20.1: Document Multi-Agent Coordination Performance Limits

## Pre-Cleanup Assessment

### Repository State Analysis

```bash
# Current repository status
```

- [ ] Repository files count: ~1000+ files
- [ ] Documentation files count: 50+ .md files
- [ ] Test files count: 120+ test files
- [ ] Open TODO/FIXME items: To be assessed
- [ ] Current test coverage: To be measured
- [ ] Failing tests: To be identified
- [ ] Linting issues: To be identified
- [ ] Type errors: To be identified

### Task 20.1 Specific Status

- [x] Performance documentation generator created with TDD
- [x] Tests written and passing (14/14 tests)
- [x] Script created to generate documentation
- [x] Comprehensive documentation generated
- [x] Existing PERFORMANCE_LIMITS_DOCUMENTATION.md updated
- [ ] Full cleanup process not yet executed

## Cleanup Objectives

### Immediate Objectives (Phase 1)

- [ ] Analyze current repository state
- [ ] Identify technical debt related to performance documentation
- [ ] Create comprehensive cleanup plan
- [ ] Document all findings

### Repository Cleanup (Phase 2)

- [ ] Remove obsolete performance test artifacts
- [ ] Clean up old benchmark results
- [ ] Remove duplicate performance documentation
- [ ] Consolidate performance-related files

### Documentation Consolidation (Phase 3)

- [ ] Merge redundant performance documentation
- [ ] Update cross-references in documentation
- [ ] Create unified performance documentation index
- [ ] Remove outdated performance claims

### Code Quality Resolution (Phase 4)

- [ ] Fix all type errors in performance modules
- [ ] Resolve pre-commit hook issues
- [ ] Run and fix all failing tests
- [ ] Achieve 100% green CI status

### Git Workflow (Phase 5)

- [ ] Stage all changes appropriately
- [ ] Create atomic commits with clear messages
- [ ] Update task status in task-master
- [ ] Document learnings in CLAUDE.md

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All automated checks pass: `make format && make test && make lint`
- [ ] Zero failing tests
- [ ] Zero linting issues
- [ ] Zero type errors
- [ ] Performance documentation is comprehensive and accurate
- [ ] No obsolete performance files remaining
- [ ] Task 20.1 marked as done in task-master

## Specific Areas of Focus

### Performance Documentation

- Generated documentation in `performance_documentation/`
- Updated `PERFORMANCE_LIMITS_DOCUMENTATION.md`
- New tools in `tools/performance_documentation_generator.py`
- Test coverage in `tests/unit/test_performance_documentation_generator.py`

### Performance Test Files

- `tests/performance/` directory
- `benchmarks/` directory
- Performance analysis scripts in `scripts/`

### Areas Requiring Attention

1. Multiple performance documentation files may have overlapping content
2. Old benchmark results may need cleanup
3. Performance test artifacts may be accumulating
4. Documentation cross-references may be broken

## Timeline

- Phase 1: Research & Planning (30 min) - IN PROGRESS
- Phase 2: Repository Cleanup (45 min)
- Phase 3: Documentation Consolidation (30 min)
- Phase 4: Code Quality Resolution (60 min)
- Phase 5: Git Workflow (15 min)

Total estimated time: 3 hours

## Notes

- Following CLAUDE.md ultrathink methodology
- Zero tolerance for quality issues
- All changes must pass automated checks
- Documentation must be comprehensive and maintainable
