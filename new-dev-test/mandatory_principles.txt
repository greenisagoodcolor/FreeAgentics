93:* **All automated checks must pass:** "AUTOMATED CHECKS ARE MANDATORY. ALL hook issues are BLOCKING – EVERYTHING must be ✅ GREEN! No errors. No formatting issues. No linting problems. Zero tolerance." – The agent must treat failing tests, linters, type-checkers, or any CI hooks as show-stoppers that **must** be resolved immediately.
113:* **Production code guided by tests:** "TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT IS NON-NEGOTIABLE. Every single line of production code must be written in response to a failing test. No exceptions." – You are **not allowed** to write any implementation code unless you have a test that fails because of the absence of that code.
