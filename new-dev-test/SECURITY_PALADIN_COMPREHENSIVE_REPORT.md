## CONCLUSION

The FreeAgentics platform has made significant security improvements, particularly in eliminating all dependency vulnerabilities. However, critical issues remain with JWT key management and authentication that require immediate attention.

### Final Score: 85/100 (B+)

**Strengths:**

- Zero dependency vulnerabilities
- Strong infrastructure security
- Good security foundation

**Critical Gaps:**

- Private key in source control
- JWT verification bypass
- Weak password validation
- Unprotected API endpoints

With the implementation of the priority remediation items, the platform can achieve an A+ security rating and full compliance with security best practices.
