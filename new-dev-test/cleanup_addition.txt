**COMPREHENSIVE CLEANUP PROCESS (MANDATORY)**: Before marking this subtask complete, perform comprehensive repository cleanup using ultrathink methodology:

1. **ULTRATHINK RESEARCH & PLANNING** (30 min):
   - Re-read all 1051 lines of CLAUDE.md to refresh methodology
   - Analyze current repository state and identify cleanup opportunities
   - Create systematic cleanup plan with validation checkpoints

2. **REPOSITORY CLEANUP** (45 min):
   - Scan and remove tech debt: unused imports, dead code, obsolete files
   - Delete old files: *.tmp, *.backup, *.old, old test reports, cache files
   - Consolidate directories: merge duplicated structures, organize by function
   - Remove obsolete documentation and outdated information
   - Clean build artifacts: __pycache__, *.pyc, dist/, build/, node_modules/

3. **DOCUMENTATION CONSOLIDATION** (30 min):
   - Update and consolidate documentation into README structure
   - Minimize separate documents by merging related content
   - Create clear documentation order for new developers
   - Ensure logical onboarding path with numbered steps
   - Archive obsolete documentation rather than deleting

4. **CODE QUALITY RESOLUTION** (60 min):
   - Fix ALL type errors comprehensively using ultrathink approach
   - Resolve ALL pre-commit hook issues (zero tolerance policy)
   - Ensure ALL automated checks pass: `make format && make test && make lint`
   - Document and fix any red flags in code quality checks
   - Validate security baseline compliance

5. **GIT WORKFLOW** (15 min):
   - Execute proper git workflow: `git add .`, `git commit -m "[cleanup] Comprehensive cleanup for subtask X.X"`, `git push`
   - Use conventional commit messages with clear scope
   - Validate all changes are properly committed and pushed

**VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS**:
- ✅ ALL automated checks must pass (make format && make test && make lint)
- ✅ ZERO type errors allowed
- ✅ ZERO pre-commit hook failures
- ✅ Clean git working directory
- ✅ Documentation consolidated and organized
- ✅ Repository size optimized

**FAILURE PROTOCOL**: If ANY quality check fails:
1. STOP IMMEDIATELY - do not continue with other tasks
2. FIX ALL ISSUES - address every ❌ until everything is ✅ green
3. VERIFY THE FIX - re-run failed command to confirm resolution
4. CONTINUE CLEANUP - return to cleanup process
5. NEVER IGNORE - zero tolerance policy for quality issues

Use the cleanup tools: `./run_cleanup.sh` for full process or `./validate_cleanup.py` for validation only.
