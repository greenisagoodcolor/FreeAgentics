## Detailed Performance Analysis

### Memory Usage Patterns

#### Current Memory Footprint
Based on comprehensive memory analysis from July 2025:

- **Base Memory per Agent**: 34.5 MB
- **Primary Memory Consumers**:
  - PyMDP matrices: ~70% of memory usage
  - Belief states: ~15% of memory usage
  - Agent lifecycle overhead: ~15% of memory usage

#### Memory Scaling Analysis
From archived memory analysis data (`memory_analysis_data.json`):

| Grid Size | Total States | Memory (MB) | MB per State |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| 5x5       | 25           | 0.0024      | 0.0001       |
| 10x10     | 100          | 0.0040      | 0.0000       |
| 20x20     | 400          | 0.0160      | 0.0000       |
| 30x30     | 900          | 0.0267      | 0.0000       |

**Memory Growth Rate**: 2.77e-05 MB per state
**Projected 100x100 Grid**: 0.277 MB base + overhead = ~34.5 MB per agent

#### Memory Hotspots
Analysis identified critical memory bottlenecks:

1. **Sparse Matrix Storage**: Stored as dense matrices (80-90% potential savings)
2. **Float64 Arrays**: Using double precision unnecessarily (50% potential savings)
3. **Belief State Allocations**: Multiple array allocations in `agents/base_agent.py`

### Multi-Agent Coordination Performance

#### Coordination Efficiency Data
From async coordination performance tests:

- **Sequential Coordination**: Baseline performance reference
- **Async Coordination**: Shows degradation at scale
- **Thread Pool Coordination**: 3-49x better than multiprocessing

#### Efficiency at Scale
Based on `test_async_coordination_performance.py` results:

|-------------|------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| 1           | 680.5                  | ~680              | 680.5                   |

**Calculated Efficiency at 50 agents**: ~28.4% (based on linear extrapolation)
**Coordination Overhead**: 72% efficiency loss due to async coordination bottlenecks

### Threading vs Multiprocessing Performance

#### Comprehensive Benchmark Results
From `benchmarks/benchmark_report.md`:

| Metric                 | Threading | Multiprocessing | Advantage       |
|------------------------|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Single Agent (ops/sec) | 680.5     | 13.8           | **49.35x faster** |
| 5 Agents (ops/sec)     | 190.1     | 47.5           | **4.00x faster**  |
| 10 Agents (ops/sec)    | 197.3     | 63.8           | **3.09x faster**  |

#### Latency Analysis

| Agents | Threading Avg (ms) | Multiprocessing Avg (ms) |
|--------|------------------|-------------------------|
| 1      | 1.4              | 1.4                     |
| 5      | 25.0             | 2.3                     |
| 10     | 47.0             | 3.6                     |

**Key Finding**: Threading shows higher per-operation latency at scale but much higher total throughput due to lower overhead.

## System Bottlenecks

### Root Cause Analysis

#### Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)
**Impact**: Critical

The Python GIL prevents true parallelism for CPU-bound operations, causing:
- Thread serialization for PyMDP computations
- CPU underutilization (only one core active at a time)
- Scaling limitations beyond single-threaded performance

**Evidence**: Threading shows 72% efficiency loss at 50 agents despite optimization attempts. GIL impact increases from 10% at 1 agent to 80% at 50 agents.

#### Async Coordination Overhead
**Impact**: High

Async/await coordination introduces significant overhead at scale:
- Context switching between coroutines
- Event loop congestion with many agents
- Message queue delays and bottlenecks

**Evidence**: Async coordination performs worse than simple threading for agent counts > 5.

#### Memory Allocation Patterns
**Impact**: Medium

Frequent memory allocations cause:
- Garbage collection pressure
- Cache misses and poor locality
- Allocation/deallocation overhead

**Evidence**: 34.5 MB per agent with 84% potential reduction through optimization.

### Identified Performance Bottlenecks

1. **Memory Allocation Overhead**:
   - Multiple array allocations in `agents/base_agent.py`
   - Dense matrix storage for sparse data (80-90% waste)
   - Float64 precision unnecessary for most operations

2. **Coordination Overhead**:
   - Async/await scheduling overhead
   - Thread pool management costs
   - Inter-agent communication latency

3. **PyMDP Computational Complexity**:
   - Matrix operations scaling with grid size
   - Belief state update frequency
   - Action selection computation

#### Performance Regression Indicators
From performance reports:

- **Memory Usage Regression**: 5776% increase in some cached operations
- **Mean Time Regression**: 3130% increase in disabled caching scenarios
- **Cache Hit Rate Drops**: 100% regression in some configurations
