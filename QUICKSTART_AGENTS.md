# Quick Start: Enable Agent Conversations

## Current Status âœ…
- Infrastructure is fully operational
- WebSocket connections are working
- Agent creation pipeline is ready
- Conversation UI is connected

## The Missing Piece ðŸ”‘
You need to add a valid OpenAI API key to enable real agent conversations.

## Steps to Enable Agent Conversations:

### 1. Get Your OpenAI API Key
- Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Create a new API key
- Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)

### 2. Add Key to FreeAgentics
1. Click the **Settings** button (gear icon) in the top-right corner
2. Paste your OpenAI API key in the field
3. Click **Save** to store the key securely

### 3. Test Agent Conversations
Try these prompts to see agents collaborate:

```
"Help me create a sustainable coffee shop business plan"
```
This will create multiple agents that analyze market conditions, sustainability practices, and business strategies.

```
"Design an AI-powered learning platform for kids"
```
This creates agents for educational design, user experience, and technical architecture.

```
"Can my agents talk to each other about active inference?"
```
This creates agents that discuss PyMDP models and knowledge graphs.

## What Happens Next ðŸš€

Once you add your API key:
1. Your prompts create real PyMDP active inference agents
2. Agents communicate with each other using the LLM
3. Multi-agent conversations appear in the conversation window
4. Knowledge graphs update based on agent interactions
5. Agents collaborate to solve complex problems

## Troubleshooting

If you still see errors after adding your key:
- Ensure the key starts with `sk-` and is valid
- Check that you have API credits/billing set up
- Try refreshing the page after saving the key

## The North Star Goal ðŸŒŸ

With a valid API key, FreeAgentics transforms from a demo into a powerful multi-agent system where:
- Agents autonomously propose new PyMDP models
- Knowledge graphs evolve through agent interactions
- Complex business problems get collaborative AI solutions
- Active inference drives intelligent decision-making

Your agents are ready to talk - they just need the API key to speak! ðŸŽ¯
