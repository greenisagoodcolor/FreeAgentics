# FreeAgentics Threading vs Multiprocessing Benchmarks

This directory contains comprehensive benchmarks comparing threading and multiprocessing approaches for FreeAgentics Active Inference agents.

## Overview

The benchmarks measure real-world performance characteristics including:

- **Performance Metrics**: Throughput, latency, scaling efficiency
- **Memory Usage**: Per-agent and total memory consumption
- **Communication Overhead**: Inter-agent messaging costs
- **Realistic Scenarios**: Exploration, coordination, and learning tasks

## Files

### `threading_vs_multiprocessing_benchmark.py`

**Comprehensive benchmark suite** that tests both threading and multiprocessing across multiple scenarios:

- **Exploration workloads**: Independent agents exploring environments
- **Coordination workloads**: Agents communicating and coordinating
- **Scaling analysis**: Performance from 1 to 30+ agents
- **Memory profiling**: Detailed memory usage tracking
- **Communication overhead**: Measuring inter-agent messaging costs

**Usage:**

```bash
python benchmarks/threading_vs_multiprocessing_benchmark.py
```

**Expected runtime**: 10-20 minutes for full benchmark suite

### `quick_threading_vs_multiprocessing_test.py`

**Rapid validation test** that runs quickly to validate the approach:

- **Fast execution**: 1-2 minutes total runtime
- **Core comparisons**: Performance and memory for key scenarios
- **Communication test**: Direct comparison of messaging overhead
- **Immediate results**: Quick feedback on which approach is better

**Usage:**

```bash
python benchmarks/quick_threading_vs_multiprocessing_test.py
```

**Expected runtime**: 1-2 minutes

## Key Metrics

### Performance Metrics

- **Throughput**: Operations per second (higher is better)
- **Latency**: Time per operation in milliseconds (lower is better)
- **P95/P99 Latency**: 95th and 99th percentile response times
- **Scaling Efficiency**: How well performance scales with agent count

### Memory Metrics

- **Per-agent Memory**: Memory usage per agent instance
- **Total Memory**: Overall memory consumption
- **Memory Delta**: Memory increase during benchmark

### Communication Metrics

- **Message Throughput**: Messages per second
- **Message Latency**: Time per message
- **Overhead Ratio**: Relative communication cost

## Expected Results

Based on the theoretical analysis, we expect:

### Threading Advantages

- **Better Performance**: 2-10x faster for PyMDP computations
- **Lower Memory**: 3-5x less memory usage due to shared memory
- **Faster Communication**: 10-100x faster inter-agent messaging
- **Better Scaling**: More efficient with 20+ agents

### Multiprocessing Advantages

- **True Parallelism**: Can overcome GIL limitations
- **Fault Isolation**: Process crashes don't affect others
- **CPU-Intensive Tasks**: Better for pure computation workloads

## Interpreting Results

### Performance Comparison

Look for:

- **Throughput ratios**: Threading should be 2-5x faster
- **Memory efficiency**: Threading should use 50-80% less memory
- **Communication overhead**: Threading should be 10-100x faster

### Production Recommendations

- **Use Threading** for most FreeAgentics scenarios
- **Consider Multiprocessing** only for:
  - Very CPU-intensive custom models
  - Fault isolation requirements
  - Integration with non-Python components

## Running the Benchmarks

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install psutil numpy
```

### Quick Test (Recommended First)

```bash
cd /path/to/FreeAgentics
python benchmarks/quick_threading_vs_multiprocessing_test.py
```

### Full Benchmark Suite

```bash
cd /path/to/FreeAgentics
python benchmarks/threading_vs_multiprocessing_benchmark.py
```

Results are saved to `benchmark_results.json` for further analysis.

## Benchmark Architecture

### Threading Implementation

- Uses `OptimizedThreadPoolManager` from FreeAgentics
- Shared memory model with thread-safe operations
- Direct memory access for communication
- Thread pool scaling based on load

### Multiprocessing Implementation

- Uses `ProcessPoolExecutor` for agent processes
- `Manager` for shared state coordination
- `Queue` for inter-process communication
- Process-based isolation

### Workload Generation

- **Exploration**: Independent agent navigation
- **Coordination**: Multi-agent communication scenarios
- **Realistic Patterns**: Based on actual Active Inference use cases
- **Parameterized**: Configurable agent counts and operation counts

## Validation

The benchmarks validate key claims:

1. **Performance**: Threading is faster for PyMDP-based agents
2. **Memory**: Threading uses significantly less memory
3. **Communication**: Threading has much lower communication overhead
4. **Scaling**: Threading scales better with agent count

Results help make informed decisions about the optimal concurrency model for FreeAgentics deployments.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Multiprocessing startup errors**:

- Ensure `mp.set_start_method('spawn')` is called
- Check Python version compatibility

**Memory measurement issues**:

- Run with sufficient system memory
- Close other applications during benchmarking

**Performance variations**:

- Run multiple times and average results
- Consider system load and background processes

### Platform-Specific Notes

**Linux**: Generally shows best performance for both approaches
**Windows**: May show different multiprocessing overhead
**macOS**: Possible spawn method restrictions

## Contributing

When adding new benchmarks:

1. Follow the existing pattern for result collection
2. Use `BenchmarkResult` dataclass for consistency
3. Include memory tracking
4. Add comprehensive error handling
5. Document expected behavior

## Benchmark Results Summary

Based on initial testing on a 20-core Linux system:

| Metric       | Threading     | Multiprocessing | Threading Advantage |
| ------------ | ------------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| Single Agent | 680.5 ops/sec | 13.8 ops/sec    | **49.35x faster**   |
| 5 Agents     | 190.1 ops/sec | 47.5 ops/sec    | **4.00x faster**    |
| 10 Agents    | 197.3 ops/sec | 63.8 ops/sec    | **3.09x faster**    |

**Key Finding**: Threading is consistently faster due to:

- Lower process startup overhead (0.03s vs 1.45s)
- Shared memory model efficiency
- Better PyMDP computation patterns
- Faster inter-agent communication

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements:
