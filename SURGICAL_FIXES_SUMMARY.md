# Surgical Fixes Summary - FreeAgentics Dev Mode

## Authentication Bypass for Dev Mode

### Problem
- REST API endpoints were requiring authentication even in dev mode
- 401/403 errors preventing first-time developers from testing
- Dev mode should work without any authentication setup

### Solution Implemented
1. Created `/auth/dev_auth_simple.py` - Simple dev user that bypasses all auth checks
2. Updated `/api/ui_compatibility.py` to use the dev user in all endpoints
3. Auth is now completely bypassed when `auth_required=False` in environment config

### Files Changed
- Created: `/auth/dev_auth_simple.py`
- Created: `/auth/dev_bypass.py` (intermediate solution)
- Modified: `/api/ui_compatibility.py` - Changed auth dependency

### Testing
All endpoints now work without authentication:
- `GET /api/agents` - Returns empty list initially
- `POST /api/agents` - Creates agents successfully  
- `GET /api/knowledge-graph` - Returns mock graph data
- `GET /api/v1/dev-config` - Provides dev token (optional)

### Verification
```bash
# Test without any auth
curl http://localhost:8000/api/agents

# Create an agent
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/agents \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"description": "Test agent"}'
```

## Remaining Issues
1. WebSocket still requires token - needs similar bypass mechanism
2. Frontend still tries to use token from localStorage

## Next Steps
1. Apply similar auth bypass to WebSocket endpoints
2. Update frontend to skip auth in dev mode
3. Test full end-to-end flow from fresh clone
