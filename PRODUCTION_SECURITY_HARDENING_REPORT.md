- ✅ Read-only filesystems with minimal tmpfs mounts
- ✅ Dropped all capabilities with minimal required additions
- ✅ Security profiles (AppArmor, no-new-privileges)
- ✅ Resource limits to prevent DoS attacks
- ✅ Network isolation with custom bridge networks
- ✅ Comprehensive health checks and monitoring
- ✅ Secure logging with rotation and size limits

### Key Security Controls

1. **Container Hardening:**
   ```yaml
   security_opt:
     - no-new-privileges:true
     - apparmor:docker-default
   cap_drop:
     - ALL
   read_only: true
   user: "1000:1000"
   ```

2. **Network Security:**
   ```yaml
   networks:
     freeagentics-network:
       driver: bridge
       ipam:
         config:
           - subnet: 172.20.0.0/16
   ```

3. **Resource Controls:**
   ```yaml
   deploy:
     resources:
       limits:
