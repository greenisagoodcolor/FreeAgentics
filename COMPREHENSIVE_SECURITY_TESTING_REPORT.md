- Add more sophisticated attack pattern recognition

## Security Test Suite Implementation

### Comprehensive Security Validation Script

A new comprehensive security validation script has been created at:

```
/home/green/FreeAgentics/tests/security/comprehensive_security_validation.py
```

This script provides:

1. **Automated Security Testing** - All security modules tested automatically
1. **Detailed Reporting** - JSON and human-readable reports
1. **Compliance Checking** - OWASP Top 10 compliance validation
1. **Threat Simulation** - Penetration testing scenarios
1. **Continuous Monitoring** - Can be integrated into CI/CD pipeline

### Test Coverage Areas

The comprehensive test suite covers:

- **Authentication Attacks:** SQL injection, credential stuffing, brute force
- **Authorization Bypass:** Role escalation, permission bypass
- **SSL/TLS Configuration:** Cipher strength, TLS versions, HSTS
- **Security Headers:** All standard security headers
- **Rate Limiting:** DDoS protection, request throttling
- **JWT Security:** Token manipulation, algorithm confusion
- **RBAC:** Role-based access control validation
- **Security Monitoring:** Event detection and alerting
- **Incident Response:** Incident handling and escalation
- **Penetration Testing:** Path traversal, XSS, command injection

## OWASP Top 10 Compliance Status
