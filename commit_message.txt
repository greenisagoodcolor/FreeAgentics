feat(core): implement unified dev/demo mode with provider injection

Replace split demo vs dev workflows with intelligent provider injection system
that auto-configures based on environment. Single `make dev` command now
handles all scenarios.

Changes:
- Add core/providers.py with factory pattern for db/cache/llm providers
- Add auth/dev_auth.py for automatic JWT generation in demo mode
- Add api/v1/dev_config.py endpoint for frontend configuration
- Add api/v1/knowledge_graph.py to fix missing UI endpoint
- Update Makefile to use unified scripts/dev.py launcher
- Update database/session.py to delegate to provider system
- Add comprehensive tests for provider selection and dev mode
- Remove demo-specific bypass code in favor of proper abstraction

Breaking changes:
- `make demo` now just calls `make dev` (behavior unchanged)
- DEMO_MODE checks replaced with ProviderMode.get_mode()
- WebSocket demo endpoint remains at /api/v1/ws/demo for compatibility

The system now provides:
- Zero-config development: just `make dev` works out of the box
- Progressive enhancement: add DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL, or API keys as needed
- Same code paths: no special demo bypasses, just different providers
- Better observability: clear logs showing which providers are active

Fixes authentication 403 errors by auto-generating admin tokens in demo mode
while maintaining full security in production.
