# Knowledge Graph Type Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Imports
- Added missing `Text` import in `version_storage.py`
- Fixed import issues in `evolution.py` by removing try/except fallback imports

### 2. Type Annotations
- Added proper type annotations for SQLAlchemy Base class using `DeclarativeMeta`
- Added type annotations for dictionaries and lists in `evolution.py`:
  - `clusters: List[List[KnowledgeNode]]`
  - `nodes_by_subject: Dict[str, List[KnowledgeNode]]`

### 3. Syntax Errors
- Fixed unterminated docstring in `version_storage.py` (line 61)
- Fixed GraphLayout missing `to_dict()` method in `visualization_models.py`

### 4. GraphDiff Instantiation
- Added missing `changed_properties` and `source` fields to all GraphDiff instantiations in `versioning.py`

### 5. SQLAlchemy Type Issues
- Added type ignore comments for SQLAlchemy model classes inheriting from Base
- Fixed datetime assignment false positive with type ignore comment
- Fixed visualization model conversions by adding proper type casting

### 6. Optimistic Locking
- Added missing `get_current_version` method to `OptimisticLockingManager`
- Added backward compatibility aliases and context manager implementation
- Added stub `get_version_manager` function

### 7. Graph Engine Usage
- Fixed usage of `graph.nodes` dictionary by using `.values()` to iterate over nodes

## Remaining Issues
The remaining ~90 type errors are mostly related to:
- Complex type inference in SQLAlchemy relationships
- Some missing type stubs for third-party libraries
- Advanced generic type constraints

These can be addressed incrementally without affecting functionality.
