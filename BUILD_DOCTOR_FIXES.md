# BUILD-DOCTOR Agent #4 - Fixes Applied

## Summary of Build Issues Fixed

### Frontend Build Fixes

1. **Missing Dependencies**
   - Added `zod` - Required by lib/env.ts for environment validation
   - Added `tailwind-merge` - Required by lib/utils.ts for CSS class merging
   - Added `clsx` - Required by lib/utils.ts for conditional classes
   - Added `web-vitals` - Required by lib/web-vitals.ts for performance monitoring

2. **Version Mismatch**
   - Updated Next.js from 14.0.0 to 14.2.30 to match installed version

3. **Directory Structure**
   - Removed conflicting `pages` directory (project uses App Router with `app` directory)

### Build Commands Verified

```bash
# Frontend build
npm run build              # ✅ Working
npm run build:frontend     # ✅ Working

# Backend build  
make build                 # ✅ Working

# Docker build
docker-compose build backend-dev  # ✅ Working
```

### Files Modified

1. `/home/green/FreeAgentics/web/package.json`
   - Updated Next.js version
   - Dependencies are automatically updated via npm install

2. `/home/green/FreeAgentics/BUILD_STATUS_REPORT.md`
   - Created comprehensive build status report

3. `/home/green/FreeAgentics/verify_all_builds.sh`
   - Created build verification script for future use

### Build Output

- Frontend: Successfully generates production build in `web/.next/`
- All 8 pages pre-rendered as static content
- TypeScript compilation successful
- Only 1 minor ESLint warning (non-critical)

## Next Steps

1. The ESLint warning about `<img>` in avatar.tsx can be fixed later (non-critical)
2. All builds are now functional and ready for deployment
3. Use `verify_all_builds.sh` for future build verification
