# 🚨 NEMESIS RELEASE BLOCKERS - v1.0.0-alpha+

**Date**: July 21, 2025  
**Verdict**: **RELEASE BLOCKED** - Project NOT ready for investment evaluation

## CRITICAL BLOCKERS (Must Fix)

### 1. **Core Functionality PARTIALLY INTEGRATED** 🚧  
- [x] ✅ GMN Specification: IMPLEMENTED! Parser + PyMDP integration working
- [ ] Multi-Agent Coordination: Currently 15% → Need 100%  
- [ ] Knowledge Graph Integration: Currently 0% → Need 100%
- [ ] D3 Visualization: Currently 40% → Need 100%
- [ ] End-to-End Pipeline (Prompt→LLM→GMN→PyMDP→KG→D3): GMN→PyMDP ✅, rest NOT WORKING

### 2. **Test Suite SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED** 🚧
- [x] ✅ Fix 5+ test collection errors - ALL FIXED! 300 tests now collect
- [x] ✅ Coverage tool detection working properly
- [ ] Add integration tests for full pipeline  
- [ ] Add end-to-end tests with real agents

### 3. **Observability PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED** 🚧
- [x] ✅ /metrics endpoint: IMPLEMENTED with Prometheus metrics!
- [x] ✅ agent_spawn_total counter: WORKING
- [x] ✅ kg_node_total counter: WORKING  
- [ ] Honeycomb traces: NOT VERIFIED

### 4. **Quality Gates MIXED PROGRESS** 🚧
- [ ] ❌ 312 linting issues found (was underestimated at 33) → Need 0
- [x] ✅ Coverage tool working properly
- [ ] No performance benchmarks run → Need baseline verified
- [ ] No production docker-compose tested → Need verified deployment

### 5. **Documentation SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED** 🚧
- [x] ✅ README updated with honest assessment (20% → 25-35% complete)
- [x] ✅ Shows accurate prototype status with realistic timelines
- [x] ✅ GMN parser progress documented and working
- [ ] No API documentation → Need complete docs
- [ ] No deployment guide → Need production deployment docs

## NEMESIS MANDATE

**NO RELEASE** until ALL of the above are VERIFIED GREEN with:
- Zero bypass mechanisms
- Zero false claims
- 100% advertised functionality working
- Full containerization verified
- Reproducible by external parties

## Committee Sign-Off Required

Each mentor's standards must be met:
- [ ] Kent Beck: Full TDD with passing tests
- [ ] Robert C. Martin: Clean architecture verified
- [ ] Martin Fowler: CI/CD pipeline 100% green
- [ ] Michael Feathers: 80%+ coverage achieved
- [ ] Jessica Kerr/Charity Majors: Full observability
- [ ] Sindre Sorhus: Zero bypasses confirmed
- [ ] Addy Osmani/Rich Harris: Performance verified
- [ ] Sarah Drasner: Documentation complete
- [ ] Evan You: API elegance confirmed

**Current Status**: 2-3/9 Committee Members Might Approve (Significant Progress Made)

**Progress Summary**: 
- ✅ 5 major blockers resolved (GMN, tests, coverage, metrics, docs)
- 🚧 4 major areas have significant progress
- ❌ Still critical gaps in LLM, KG, D3, linting, benchmarks
