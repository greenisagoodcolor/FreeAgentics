  - Batch agent spawning performance
  - Concurrent agent creation scalability

- **Message Throughput Benchmarks**
  - Single message passing latency
  - Bulk message processing throughput
  - Async message handling performance

- **Memory Usage Benchmarks**
  - Agent memory lifecycle tracking
  - Belief state compression efficiency
  - Matrix pooling optimization validation

- **Database Query Benchmarks**
  - Single query performance
  - Batch query optimization
  - Connection pool efficiency

- **WebSocket Connection Benchmarks**
  - Connection setup time
  - Concurrent connection handling
  - Message broadcasting performance

### 2. CI/CD Integration Module (`benchmarks/ci_integration.py`)

Implemented comprehensive CI/CD integration with:

- **Performance Baseline Management**
  - Automatic baseline storage and updates
  - Historical performance tracking (90-day retention)
  - Baseline comparison and validation

- **Regression Detection**
  - Configurable thresholds (10% critical, 5% warning)
  - Automatic detection of performance degradations
  - Severity classification and reporting

- **Reporting Features**
  - JSON-based performance reports
  - GitHub PR comment generation
  - Performance trend analysis
  - Visual dashboard support

### 3. GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/performance.yml`)

Created a comprehensive CI/CD workflow that:

- **Triggers**
  - Runs on every push to main/develop branches
  - Executes on all pull requests
  - Daily scheduled runs at 2 AM UTC
  - Manual workflow dispatch with options

- **Features**
  - Multi-Python version testing (3.11, 3.12)
  - Automatic regression detection with CI failure on >10% degradation
  - PR comments with performance impact summary
  - Baseline updates on successful main branch runs
  - Performance dashboard generation for scheduled runs
  - Optional profiling with `[profile]` in commit messages

- **Artifacts**
  - Performance results with 30-day retention
  - Historical comparison reports
  - Performance dashboards with 90-day retention

### 4. Performance Regression Tests (`tests/benchmarks/test_performance_regression.py`)

Comprehensive test suite that validates:

- **Memory Tracking**
  - MemoryTracker functionality
  - Peak memory detection
  - Memory growth calculation

- **Benchmark Metrics**
  - Metrics collection and calculation
  - Performance tracking context manager
  - Exception handling during benchmarks

- **Regression Detection**
  - Baseline management
  - Regression threshold validation
  - Improvement detection
  - Severity classification

- **CI Integration**
  - End-to-end workflow testing
  - GitHub comment generation
  - Report generation and validation

### 5. Documentation and Tooling

- **Updated Dependencies**
  - Added `pytest-benchmark==5.1.0` to requirements-dev.txt
  - Added `psutil==6.0.0` for system metrics

- **Documentation**
  - Created `PERFORMANCE_BENCHMARKS_README.md` with comprehensive guide
  - Detailed usage instructions and best practices
  - Troubleshooting guide

- **Helper Scripts**
  - `run_performance_benchmarks.sh` - Convenient script to run benchmarks locally
  - Support for filtering, profiling, and baseline updates

## Key Features

### 1. Automated Performance Testing
- Comprehensive benchmark coverage across all major components
- Statistical analysis with mean, median, and standard deviation
- Warm-up iterations for stable results
- Configurable benchmark parameters

### 2. CI/CD Integration
- Seamless GitHub Actions integration
- Automatic PR comments with performance impact
- Fail-fast on critical regressions (>10%)
- Performance trend tracking over time

### 3. Performance Monitoring
- Real-time memory usage tracking
- CPU utilization monitoring
- Operation throughput measurement
- Historical performance analysis

### 4. Regression Detection
- Configurable regression thresholds
- Severity-based classification
- Automatic baseline updates
- Performance improvement tracking

## Performance Goals Established

Based on production requirements:
- **Agent Spawn Time**: <50ms per agent
- **Message Throughput**: >1000 messages/second  
- **Memory per Agent**: <35MB
- **Database Query**: <10ms average
- **WebSocket Setup**: <100ms

## Usage Examples

### Local Benchmarking
```bash
# Run all benchmarks
./benchmarks/run_performance_benchmarks.sh

# Run with baseline update
./benchmarks/run_performance_benchmarks.sh --update-baseline

# Quick benchmarks
./benchmarks/run_performance_benchmarks.sh --quick

# Filter specific benchmarks
./benchmarks/run_performance_benchmarks.sh --filter "agent_spawn"
```

### CI/CD Integration
```bash
# Check for regressions
python benchmarks/ci_integration.py \
  --results-file results/benchmark_results.json \
  --fail-on-regression

# Update baseline
python benchmarks/ci_integration.py \
  --results-file results/benchmark_results.json \
  --update-baseline
```

## Benefits

1. **Proactive Performance Management**: Catch regressions before they reach production
2. **Data-Driven Decisions**: Historical trends inform optimization efforts
3. **Automated Quality Gates**: CI fails on performance degradation
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All major components are benchmarked
5. **Easy Extension**: Simple to add new benchmarks following established patterns

## Next Steps

The performance benchmarking infrastructure is now fully integrated and ready for use. Teams can:

1. Run benchmarks locally during development
2. Monitor CI/CD for performance regressions
3. Track performance trends over time
4. Add new benchmarks as features are developed
5. Use profiling data to identify optimization opportunities

The system will automatically track performance, detect regressions, and ensure the FreeAgentics project maintains high performance standards throughout its development lifecycle.
