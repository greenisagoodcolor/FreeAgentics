## 🎯 What is FreeAgentics?

FreeAgentics creates ** AI agents** using **Active Inference** - a mathematical framework from cognitive science. Unlike chatbots or scripted AI, our agents make decisions by minimizing free energy, leading to emergent, intelligent behavior.

### ⚡ Key Features

- 🧠 **Mathematical Rigor**: Based on peer-reviewed Active Inference theory (pymdp)
- 🤖 **True Autonomy**: No hardcoded behaviors - all actions emerge from principles
- 👥 **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Agents form coalitions and collaborate dynamically
- 🎮 **Real-time Visualization**: Live dashboard showing belief states and decisions
- 🚀 **Production Ready**: Enterprise-grade performance and edge deployment
- 📝 **Natural Language**: Create agents using human-readable specifications

## 🚀 Quick Start & Developer Setup

### **2-Minute Start**

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

FreeAgentics uses a **streamlined testing approach** focused on clarity and effectiveness:

### **Core Testing Commands**

| Command              | What It Includes                    | When To Use                | Time     |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------- |
| `test`               | **Unit tests (backend + frontend)** | During development         | ~2min    |
| `test-release`       | **Complete production validation**   | Before releases           | ~40min   |
| `coverage`           | **Coverage reports generation**      | Quality assessment        | ~5min    |
| `docker`             | **Production Docker deployment**     | Production releases        | ~10min   |
| `docker-validate`    | **Docker configuration validation**  | Pre-deployment checks      | ~3min    |

### **Testing Philosophy**

Following Arch Linux principles of simplicity and clarity:
- **`make test`**: Fast feedback during development
- **`make test-release`**: Comprehensive validation for production
- **`make coverage`**: Detailed coverage analysis when needed

#### 🚀 `make test-release` - Production Validation (40 minutes)
**6-Phase comprehensive validation:**
1. **Code Quality Analysis** - Linting and type checking
2. **Unit Testing** - Backend and frontend with coverage
3. **Integration Testing** - API and component integration
4. **Security Scanning** - Vulnerability and dependency audits
5. **Production Build** - Full build verification
6. **Report Generation** - Comprehensive validation summary

**Generates**: Complete validation report in `test-reports/`
**Purpose**: Production readiness confirmation

## 🔧 Customization by Developer Type

**React Developers**: Explore `web/components/dashboard/TilingWindowManager.tsx` and `design-tokens.css`  
**Python/AI Developers**: Check `agents/` and `inference/engine/` for Active Inference math  
**Full-Stack Developers**: API layer in `api/main.py` and `websocket/` real-time updates

## 🆘 Common Issues & Fixes

**"Port already in use"** → `make kill-ports`  
**"Module not found"** → `make clean && make install`  
**"Tests failing"** → `make test-full --tb=long --vvv` (max verbosity)  
**"White screen"** → `make dev-frontend` (check build errors)  
**"Agents not responding"** → `make dev-backend` (check Python logs)
